            "South Korean stocks opened higher on Thursday, heading to set a new all-time high, as investor sentiment was boosted by overnight gains on Wall Street driven by growing hopes for a rate cut by the Federal Reserve and a rally of artificial intelligence shares. The benchmark Korea Composite Stock Price Index added 20.16 points, or 0.61 percent, to 3,334.69 in the first 15 minutes of trading, breaking the record high of 3,314.53 posted the previous day. Overnight, the S&P 500 closed 0.3 percent higher and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite inched up 0.03 percent, driven by sharp gains in cloud provider Oracle and AI-related shares, such as Nvidia, AMD and Broadcom. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, closed 0.48 percent lower. The fresh US producer price data, which showed a decline for the first time in four months, also boosted optimism that the Fed will cut its key rate next week. Investors' eyes are now on the US consumer price index for August due out on Thursday, which will provide additional clues for the Fed's monetary direction. In Seoul, chip shares led the Kospi's rise. Market bellwether Samsung Electronics increased 1.1 percent, and its chipmaking rival SK hynix soared 2.63 percent. Leading battery maker LG Energy Solution jumped 2.64 percent, and defense powerhouse Hanwha Aerospace climbed 1.65 percent. Major shipbuilders also kicked off strong, with Hanwha Ocean jumping 1.26 percent and HD Korea Shipbuilding rising 1.21 percent. But No. 1 financial firm KB Financial lost 1.7 percent, and power plant manufacturer Doosan Enerbility dropped 0.96 percent. The local currency was trading at 1,388.5 won against US dollar at 9:15 a.m., down 1.9 won from the previous session. (Yonhap) \n",

            "Ten companies stood firmer on Wednesday, outperforming a mixed performance on the broader market, as investors cheered cooler-than-expected inflation data, while placing bets on renewed optimism for artificial intelligence.On Wall Street, only the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq finished in the green, up 0.30 percent and 0.03 percent, respectively. The Dow Jones, for its part, lost 0.48 percent.Meanwhile, our list of 10 top performers on Wednesday was dominated by companies riding the AI boom, thanks to eye-popping developments in the overall industry. In this article, we detail the reasons behind their gains.To come up with the list, we considered the stocks with at least $2 billion in market capitalization and 5 million shares in trading volume. Photo by Jonathan Borba on Pexels10. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)Shares of Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) rallied to a new all-time high on Wednesday as investors gobbled up shares on optimism that it could generate $120 billion in AI revenues over the next five years.In intra-day trading, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) soared to its highest 52-week price of $372.97, before trimming gains to end the day just up by 9.77 percent at $369.57 apiece.This followed a regulatory filing that Broadcom Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AVGO) board of directors moved to grant CEO Hock Tan a total of 610,521 performance stock units (PSU) that could generate him more than $676.89 million over the next five years.Under the terms, the PSUs will be awarded if Tan can make Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) generate $120 billion in AI revenues by 2030.In case the maximum revenue target is not met, Tan will still be able to receive a 200-percent payout percentage of the PSU if the company books $105 billion in AI revenues; 100 percent in case of $90 billion in AI revenues; and none if the company clocks in $60 billion and below by the said timeline.In case Tan leaves the company early, he could lose the award completely, except if for a good reason or is let go without cause, dies, or becomes permanently disabled.In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, the company generated $12.2 billion in AI revenues, expanding 220 percent year-on-year.In the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) generated $5.2 billion in revenues from AI.9. Credo Technology Group Holding Ltd (NASDAQ:CRDO)Credo Technology surged to a new all-time high on Wednesday, jumping 10.02 percent to close at $163.96 apiece as investors cheered the launch of a new digital signal processor (DSP) designed to support the requirements of next-generation Artificial Intelligence.In intra-day trading, Credo Technology Group Holding Ltd (NASDAQ:CRDO) climbed to its fresh 52-week high of $164.04 before trimming gains to end the day just up by 10.02 percent at $163.96 apiece. Wednesday also marked its 7th straight day of gains.This followed the company’s launch of the Bluebird on Tuesday, a high-performance, low-power DSP for 1.6 terabits per second (Tbps) optical transceivers, which enables energy-efficient data transmission essential to unlocking the advanced computational power of state-of-the-art GPU silicon.“Next-generation AI networks require high-bandwidth, ultra-low latency, extreme reliability, and exceptional power efficiency. Many existing 1.6T transceivers suffer from high levels of power dissipation, constraining deployments due to the challenges with cooling and power delivery. This places limits on the widespread adoption of 1.6T technology,” Credo Technology Group Holding Ltd (NASDAQ:CRDO) said.“The Credo Bluebird DSP aims to address these challenges by leveraging advanced CMOS process technology and Credo’s proprietary design techniques to deliver industry-leading power efficiency, allowing 1.6T transceivers to consume well under 20W,” it added.8. Cipher Mining Inc. (NASDAQ:CIFR)Cipher Mining rallied for a fourth straight day on Wednesday to touch a new 52-week high, as investors continued to place bets on digital infrastructure players amid renewed optimism for artificial intelligence.In intra-day trading, Cipher Mining Inc. (NASDAQ:CIFR) climbed to its highest price of $10.43 before paring gains to end the day just up by 11.17 percent at $10.25 apiece. Wednesday also marked its fourth straight day of gains.Following Nebius Group’s $18-billion cloud computing deal with technology giant Microsoft Corp., investors were quick to pile funds into Bitcoin miners, including Cipher Mining Inc. (NASDAQ:CIFR), which also operates high-performance computing (HPC).At present, Cipher Mining Inc. (NASDAQ:CIFR) is underway with the expansion of its Black Pearl sites to support the growing demand in HPC from both AI and hydro-Bitcoin mining.According to CEO Tyler Page, the site is expected to be fully leased by HPC tenants.“By taking this approach to building infrastructure today, we will be prepared to sign tenants when they are ready, while also preserving our flexibility to use the space for bitcoin mining in the near term, if preferred. In short, Black Pearl Phase II infrastructure will enable us to monetize access to power quickly, whether via HPC tenants or bitcoin mining,” he added.7. IREN Ltd. (NASDAQ:IREN)IREN Ltd. extended its winning streak to a fourth consecutive day on Wednesday to reach another all-time high as investors took path from an investment firm’s price target upgrade, alongside continued optimism for the artificial intelligence sector.During the session, IREN Ltd. (NASDAQ:IREN) climbed to its fresh 52-week peak of $33.64 before ending the day just 1 cent lower. Still, the stock was up by 11.39 percent.In a market report, capital markets firm BTIG raised its price target for IREN Ltd. (NASDAQ:IREN) to $32 from $22 previously, while maintaining a “buy” recommendation for the stock.The upgrade followed optimism from the company’s move to expand its GPU portfolio in July with the acquisition of 9,000 Nvidia GPUs, which brought its total ownership to 10,900 units. The expansion represented a fivefold increase from only 2,000 GPUs deployed in early 2024.While focused on Bitcoin mining, IREN Ltd. (NASDAQ:IREN) is also expanding its AI business through the expansion of digital infrastructure to support the sector’s needs.In August alone, IREN Ltd. (NASDAQ:IREN) announced earlier this week that revenues from its AI cloud business grew by 4.34 percent to $2.4 million last month from $2.3 million in July.6. Applied Digital Corp. (NASDAQ:APLD)Applied Digital climbed for a third straight day on Wednesday, adding 11.71 percent to end at $16.98 apiece as investor sentiment was boosted by an overall optimism for the artificial intelligence industry.The company rallied alongside its counterparts, as investors piled funds into digital infrastructure players after Nebius Group, formerly focused on Bitcoin mining and now pivoting into AI hosting, has clinched an $18 billion cloud computing deal with technology giant Microsoft Corp. The deal underscored market appetite for scalable computing power.For investors, placing bets in the industry could offer early exposure to a sector that is expected to boom in the future.Late last month, Applied Digital Corp. (NASDAQ:APLD) finalized an expanded lease agreement with CoreWeave that could deliver the company as much as $11 billion in revenues.The updated agreement now covers 400 MW of critical IT capacity across three long-term leases across Applied Digital Corp.’s (NASDAQ:APLD) purpose-built Polaris Forge 1 Campus in Ellendale, North Dakota.“This...lease agreement with CoreWeave underpins our commitment to building the next generation of AI infrastructure right here in America’s heartland,” said Chairman and CEO Wes Cummins. “It also further reinforces the importance of North Dakota’s role in shaping the future of the digital economy and is another step in advancing its position as one of the most strategic destinations for AI in the world.”5. Bloom Energy Corp. (NYSE:BE)Shares of Bloom Energy rallied to a new all-time high on Wednesday, as investor funds flocked into AI stocks, supported by a new $43.9 million supply deal with India-based MTAR Technologies.During the session, the stock soared to its highest 52-week price of $65.63 before trimming gains to end the day just up by 14.47 percent at $62.96 apiece.According to reports, Bloom Energy Corp. (NYSE:BE) made orders from MTAR Technologies for hot box assemblies and electrolyzer units, critical to its solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) systems.Investors took the acquisition positively, especially with energy demand from data centers continuing to grow.Last month, Bloom Energy Corp. (NYSE:BE) inked a supply agreement with Oracle Corp., under which it will deliver fuel cell technology to select Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) data centers in the US to support the growing demand for its cloud computing services. Details about expected revenues and supply volume have not been disclosed.Bloom Energy Corp. (NYSE:BE) also hinted at similar deals “coming soon.”In line with the booming artificial intelligence industry, Bloom Energy Corp. (NYSE:BE) said it was targeting to double its total capacity to 2 GW by the end of 2026 from 1 GW at present. Of the 1 GW, more than half is currently supplied to critical data centers.4. CoreWeave Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWV)CoreWeave extended its winning streak to a fourth straight day on Wednesday, surging 16.88 percent to end at $117.14 apiece as investors cheered its establishment of a new subsidiary aimed at backing companies supporting the AI ecosystem.In a statement, CoreWeave Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWV) said it launched CoreWeave Ventures, a program that aims to support startups through investments, providing its AI cloud and technical guidance, as well as connecting them with firms already using AI.“Our aim with CoreWeave Ventures is to give other audacious, like-minded founders the support they need to drive technical advancements and bring to market the next class of innovation,” said CoreWeave Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWV) founder and Chief Development Officer Brannin McBee.According to the company, the new subsidiary is already working with a diverse group of innovators, from foundational model developers building novel large language models to pioneers in vertical AI applications and infrastructure.In other developments, CoreWeave Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWV) earned a higher price target of $430 from Freedom Capital Markets, from $410 previously, while upgrading it to “hold” from “sell” previously.3. Sable Offshore Corp. (NYSE:SOC)Sable Offshore snapped a three-day losing streak on Wednesday, jumping 22.58 percent to close at $24.59 apiece as investors repositioned portfolios on optimism for the Las Flores pipeline’s restart this month.It can be recalled that Sable Offshore Corp. (NYSE:SOC), in an updated report last August, announced targets of recommencing oil sales upon the expected restart of the onshore pipeline this September.The Las Flores pipeline has been ordered shut since 2015 following a catastrophic pipeline rupture that resulted in a massive oil spill.At present, the project is facing legal and regulatory roadblocks after multiple environmental organizations challenged Sable Offshore Corp. (NYSE:SOC), barring the restart of the pipeline.In other recent news, Sable Offshore Corp. (NYSE:SOC) is facing a class action lawsuit over allegations that it provided misleading business updates, including restarting oil production off the coast when it had not, saying that statements about its “business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading.”Sable Offshore Corp. (NYSE:SOC) has yet to issue a statement on the allegations.2. Travere Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:TVTX)Travere Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:TVTX) soared to a new all-time high on Wednesday, as investors cheered the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) decision to cancel the creation of an advisory committee that would support the review of its drug application to treat focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS).During the session, Travere Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:TVTX) touched its highest price of $28.69 before trimming gains to end the day just up by 26.2 percent at $27.31 apiece.Investors took the decision positively as dropping the supposed advisory committee suggested that the FDA now has fewer concerns about the drug candidate.Called Filspari, it would be the first ever treatment for FSGS, a leading cause of kidney failures.“We are pleased with the progress of the sNDA to date and look forward to further supporting the FDA’s review of our application for Filspari in FSGS,” said Travere Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:TVTX) President and CEO Eric Dube.Expected to be approved by January 2026, Travere Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:TVTX) said it is now in preparations for the commercial launch.Filspari is an oral, non-immunosuppressive potential therapy that targets podocyte injury, a key driver of FSGS progression.“FSGS is a leading cause of kidney failure, and for too long, patients have been waiting for approved therapies for this rare and devastating disease,” Dube said.1. Oracle Corp. (NYSE:ORCL)Shares of Oracle Corp. propelled to a new all-time high on Wednesday, as investors took heart from the company’s $144 billion AI revenue target over the next four years.“We expect Oracle Cloud Infrastructure revenue to grow 77 percent to $18 billion this fiscal year—and then increase to $32 billion, $73 billion, $114 billion, and $144 billion over the subsequent four years. Most of the revenue in this 5-year forecast is already booked in our reported RPO. Oracle is off to a brilliant start to FY26,” Oracle Corp. (NYSE:ORCL) CEO Safra Catz said in a statement.In the first quarter of the year alone, Oracle Corp. (NYSE:ORCL) signed four multi-billion-dollar contracts with three customers, resulting in an RPO contract backlog of $455 billion.“It was an astonishing quarter, and demand for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure continues to build. Over the next few months, we expect to sign up several additional multi-billion-dollar customers, and RPO is likely to exceed half a trillion dollars,” she added.For his part, Chairman and CTO Larry Ellison said the company’s MultiCloud database revenues from Amazon, Google, and Microsoft alone grew at an incredible rate of 1,528 percent in the first quarter, adding that he expects the company to grow substantially every quarter in the next few years amid the targeted delivery of another 37 data centers to three of its hyperscaler partners.While we acknowledge the potential of ORCL to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ORCL and that has 100x upside potential, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.Disclosure: None.

            "The terminology you use may vary, but the thing we are talking about is the same. The terminology you use may vary, but the thing we are talking about is the same. Renewed, refurbished, pre-owned, these are smartphones that aren’t new (but they also aren’t the traditional as in ‘second hand’ or ‘used’ phones), but with an assurance that anything that needed to be has been fixed afresh, tend to deliver a lot more value and that climb up the aspirational ladder for many buyers. India’s premium renewed smartphone platform ControlZ has launched its first experience store in Gurugram, in a marked step away from the online-first and e-commerce primed approach that renewed smartphones mostly leaned on. Circling back to the fresh fixes that I touched upon earlier, ControlZ confirms every smartphone they sell undergoes more than 311 stringent quality checks and OEM-grade replacements for displays, cameras, and components. A lot of this is difficult to showcase in an online store, and the physical store should help overcome those challenges for the buyer and the seller. I asked Yug Bhatia, Founder and CEO of ControlZ, why now and how it makes things easier for consumers, and he insists this is the right time to bring that experience offline. “Consumers today care about both value and sustainability, but they also want trust. Our new store makes it easy: people can walk in, see and feel the quality for themselves, and leave with a device that’s like new—100% battery health, 18 months warranty, and zero compromise. It’s about giving people the confidence to choose renewed without a second thought,” he says. The other point of discussion revolved around consumer preferences, and how that underlines the renewed smartphone market outlook. Bhatia insists India’s renewed smartphone market is just beginning to take shape. “We believe it’s going to grow rapidly in the year ahead. Consumers are moving away from second-hand bargains and toward renewed devices that deliver quality, reliability, and peace of mind. That shift is setting new standards for the entire industry,” he says. For Bhatia, ControlZ is never about following this change, but leading it by redefining what renewed means for buyers in India. Competition in this space is increasing, and it’ll be interesting to see in a few months time, how this store has worked out for ControlZ in terms of traction. KEYNOTE MOMENTS As it is every year, Apple’s hardware keynote in 2025 too was extensive. A lot to unpack, which I did on Hindustan Times in the hours after. There’s still some unpacking to do in our weekly conversation. I’ve been speaking with analysts about their take on the announcements Apple made, as they try to make sense of it all. Are you ready? Must start with the iPhone Air, the most exciting new product announced. This is 5.6mm thick (the thinnest iPhone ever), with a 6.5-inch ProMotion display and the same A19 Pro chip that also powers the iPhone 17 Pro phones. It is a sign of the times, as Apple has to compete with the likes of Samsung’s Galaxy 25 Edge, which is 5.8mm thick. What you must ask are a series of questions. Is the iPhone Air a precursor to a foldable iPhone that’s expected next year? Is the iPhone Air a first look at the future of iPhones and not just as a separate ‘Air’ line? Is the Fusion Camera indeed a viable alternative to the versatility of a three-camera system that flagship phones have? “The iPhone 17 Air delivers notable design innovation, likely driving upgrades from loyalists of older models, including iPhone 12 through 15, while the iPhone 17 Pro lineup—with its durable, performance-focused design, enhanced battery, and advanced camera capabilities—will appeal to power users and digital natives alike. The emphasis on improved durability, including drop and scratch resistance, aligns with the growing consumer demand for longer-lasting devices,” summarises Prabhu Ram, Vice President - Industry Research Group, at CyberMedia Research (CMR). Changes on the iPhone 17 Pro line begin with the design, including a new unibody architecture, the switch to a proprietary aluminium material, the use of a Ceramic Shield instead of glass at the back to make it more scratch resistant, and of course, the brightest colour we’ve ever seen on a Pro series iPhone till now. Cosmic Orange, as it is called, will likely be the best-seller for Apple at least in initial months, because it is a step away from the traditionally serious, darker colour shades that the iPhone Pro line has always delivered. That continues to the cameras, including longer optical zoom and a larger primary sensor. The standard iPhone 17 gets a larger 6.3-inch screen size (instead of 6.1-inch) while adding an adaptive refresh rate ProMotion tech and new camera hardware including versatile selfie orientation. This runs the A19 chip, a 3-nanometer architecture chip, with a promise of better battery stamina, up to 20% faster than an iPhone 16, and a faster neural engine for artificial intelligence (AI) processing. Prices of the iPhone 17 start ₹ 82,900 with 256GB being the minimum storage spec. The iPhone 16 prices at launch, ₹ 79,900 onwards. “On the pricing front Apple has this time retained the price points except in few indicating they are expecting a flattish growth globally. Despite rupee weakening against dollar by around 5% in 2025 over 2024 they haven't made major price jumps in India,” notes Faisal Kawoosa, Chief Analyst and co-founder of Techarc. Wearables have really stepped up in terms of capabilities. The third generation AirPods Pro true wireless earbuds, features a custom advanced computational audio and custom audio drivers. Apple says the noise cancellation is optimised to be four times more effective than a previous generation, and that transparency mode is now marked by more human-like ambient voices filtering through to the ear. In our quick experience after the keynote, they aren’t wrong with their claims, with both functionalities significantly better than an earlier generation. The Apple Watch 11 gets improved cellular coverage underlined by improved hardware, heart health tracking including hypertension detection, and a up to 24 hours battery life. Alongside, the Apple Watch SE, the entry point to Apple’s Watch portfolio, gets new functionality such as sleep apnea and sleep score data, as well as 18-hour battery life with addition of fast charging. Our extensive coverage of the keynote... PASSAGE OF TIME Finally, Instagram for iPad. A 15-year wait (another thing the world’s got before GTA VI) leads us to an app that isn’t simply a stretched version of the iPhone app, so much so that this specific tablet interface will soon find space in the Instagram app for Android tablets too. “When designing Instagram for iPad, we wanted to take advantage of the bigger screen to give people more features with fewer taps, while keeping it simple,” the official statement says. Do try this out, for the iPad is often called the ultimate ‘media consumption device’ and Instagram Reels are prime content consumption in this era, and I’d love to hear your thoughts. VISION In a column recently (we didn’t get a chance to talk about this), write about the warning signs that India's telecom market is teetering on the edge of becoming a duopoly dominated by Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel, as Vodafone Idea (Vi) struggles to survive. There is an urgent need to preserve Vodafone Idea (Vi) as a significant telecom player in India. Losing Vi would erode competition—hurt price affordability, service quality, and innovation for billions of mobile users. We have seen it at multiple points in time in the past year — monthly telecom bills and recharge prices have gone up, popular affordable plans have been removed by Airtel and Jio, whilst no discernible real-world network quality improvements (do tell me if your calls no longer drop or you have full network coverage in your apartment elevator or office basement parking). I make the argument that supporting Vi isn't about corporate protectionism but a consumer welfare imperative, in the sense that diminished consumer choice, higher prices, and slowed technological advancement may be the result of a duopoly. There is a need for a clear policy intervention, if at all it is possible—like easing spectrum payment terms, restructuring debt, or other support—to help Vi stabilise and potentially regain competitiveness. Moreover, absence of incentives for new players to enter the market poses a thoughtful question — if we can’t nurture the next ‘Jio,’ alongside the current Jio, how will India stay competitive with upcoming technologies like 6G? KNOW Google will not have to sell its Chrome browser business, to address the search monopoly issue, the judge in the antitrust case has ruled. That should, for starters, put an end to all sorts of naivety where certain AI bros thought they could buy out Chrome from Google, two institutions in their own right. The judge has ruled that Google can continue to pay partners for preloading or placement of its Search or AI products, but the tech giants must share some search information with rivals and bar it from putting together any exclusive deals to distribute its Search or AI assistant products in ways that might cut off distribution for rivals. Google does contend that this guideline to share some data with rivals will impact user data privacy, and that they are looking closely at this. Big picture — this may well be the biggest signal that regulators and courts may not be as willing to break up tech giants, as many expected. OpenAI is adding a layer of parental controls to ChatGPT, which would give parents the option to link their personal ChatGPT account with the accounts of their teenage children. From then on, parents will be able to decide how ChatGPT responds to queries by their kids, as well as disable select features, including memory and chat history. Building on the emotional support aspect that OpenAI has detailed recently, the chatbot will generate automated alerts when it detects a teen in conversation, with “signs of acute distress”.

            "Samsung Display Co. will continue efforts to expand its mobility portfolio amid growing demand for organic light-emitting diode solutions in self-driving vehicles, a senior company official has said. Lee Joo-hyung, who heads the firm's mobile display business, made such remarks during a business conference Wednesday (German time) at the IAA Mobility 2025, Europe's largest mobility trade show, under way in Munich, Germany. \"Display is emerging as the connecting point between automobiles and people, as well as a digital platform amid the development of self-driving, software-defined vehicles,\" Lee said. He added, \"OLED displays will create various values as key infrastructure for future mobility, identifying surrounding objects by combining with artificial intelligence, while offering safe driving solutions through deep learning.\" In particular, the Samsung official said the company is opening more possibilities for consumers through its slidable, bendable and rollable display solutions. Lee added that Samsung Display will continue to support its clients in developing infotainment systems by allowing them to test the company's new technologies and products in a way similar to \"assembling Lego blocks.\" Citing data compiled by industry tracker Omdia, Samsung Display said the global market for mobility OLEDs was estimated at $880 million last year, with the volume projected to reach $4.8 billion by 2030. Samsung Display accounted for 55.9 percent of the market last year. (Yonhap) \n",

            "By Patricia Zengerle WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday passed its version of the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, authorizing nearly $900 billion in military spending and featuring a plan to streamline the defense acquisition process. The vote on the proposal for spending similar to last year's level was 231 to 196, largely along party lines. All but four Republicans backed the bill and all but 17 Democrats opposed, mostly due to amendments addressing divisive social issues. One such amendment would bar the Pentagon's health insurance from covering gender-related medical treatment. Representative Adam Smith of Washington, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, voted no, accusing Republicans of focusing on politics rather than security. \"They included countless partisan amendments that sought to score points in a right-wing culture war rather than focus on the real needs of our service members and their families,\" Smith said in a statement. Representative Mike Rogers of Alabama, the committee's Republican chairman, praised the House bill's passage as \"a vote to modernize our military, support our troops, and restore American deterrence.\" The measure includes a 3.8% pay raise for troops and plans to improve the military's acquisition system, including by shortening approval timelines and increasing artificial intelligence research. House members rejected amendments that would have barred funding for Ukraine and Taiwan. The Senate is considering its version of the bill, which authorizes $32 billion more spending than the House measure. When that passes, the House and Senate Armed Services committees will reach a compromise that must pass both chambers before it can be sent to the White House for President Donald Trump to sign into law or veto. Republicans on Wednesday narrowly blocked an effort by Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York to include an NDAA amendment that would have forced a vote on the release of files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The case of Epstein, who died by suicide in prison in 2019, has proved to be a political thorn in the side of Trump, a one-time friend of the sex offender.

            "VANCOUVER, BC , Sept. 10, 2025 /PRNewswire/ - Wheaton Precious MetalsTM Corp. (\"Wheaton\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce it has committed financing to Carcetti Capital Corporation (\"Carcetti\") to support Carcetti's proposed acquisition (the \"Acquisition\") of the Hemlo Mine from Barrick Mining Corporation (\"Barrick\"). Carcetti's financing package for the Acquisition is expected to include: Up to $400 million Wheaton gold stream (the \"Gold Stream\"); Concurrent equity financing with estimated proceeds of approximately $415 million (the \"Equity Financing\"); and $200 million in bank debt (the \"Acquisition Facility\"). Wheaton has committed to provide the Gold Stream and to participate in the Equity Financing (up to the lesser of $50 million or 20% of the Equity Financing), subject to execution of definitive agreements and satisfaction of customary conditions. The Gold Stream would be a key component of Carcetti's comprehensive financing package, which is expected to provide Carcetti with the capital required to complete the Acquisition and advance further improvements at Hemlo , positioning the asset to achieve its full potential. Upon closing, Carcetti intends to change its name to Hemlo Mining Corp. (\"HMC\"). \" Hemlo offers a unique opportunity to add immediate, accretive gold ounces from a politically stable jurisdiction, backed by a long history of production and a capable operating team,\" said Randy Smallwood , Chief Executive Officer of Wheaton Precious Metals. \"We are proud to support HMC in its acquisition of a mine that has long been considered a cornerstone of Canada's mining industry, while also contributing to strategic M&A momentum across the sector.\" \"The Hemlo stream reflects our commitment to disciplined capital deployment and long-term value creation,\" added Haytham Hodaly , President of Wheaton Precious Metals. \"This transaction highlights our continued focus on investing in assets with strong geological potential and responsible stewardship. We are pleased to partner with HMC, whose leadership is guided by a strong strategic vision for unlocking further value at Hemlo .\" \"We are grateful to have the support of Wheaton Precious Metals as we move forward with the acquisition of the Hemlo Gold mine,\" said Jason Kosec , incoming President & Chief Executive Officer of HMC. \"Their backing not only validates the quality of the opportunity but also strengthens our ability to unlock the mine's full potential. With Wheaton's partnership, we can responsibly maximize value from the operation, create meaningful benefits for our stakeholders, and continue building a strong Canadian intermediate growth focused gold producer.\" Gold Stream Key Terms (All values in US$ unless otherwise noted) Wheaton has committed to provide the Gold Stream on the following terms, subject to execution of definitive agreements and completion of the Acquisition: Upfront Consideration: Wheaton will pay HMC total upfront cash consideration of up to $400 million (the \"Deposit\") subject to certain customary conditions. Under the terms of Wheaton's commitment to HMC, if the Equity Financing exceeds $300 million (excluding Wheaton's participation), HMC may request that the Deposit be reduced by the amount of the excess (to a maximum of $100 million ), in which case the stream percentage would be adjusted proportionately and Wheaton's commitment to participate in the Equity Financing would be limited to the lesser of $30 million and 20% of the Equity Financing. Any such adjustments to the Deposit and stream percentage would be reflected in the definitive agreement for the Gold Stream. Streamed Metal: Wheaton will purchase 13.5% of the payable gold until a total of 181,000 ounces of gold has been delivered (the \"First Dropdown Threshold\"), at which point Wheaton will purchase 9.0% of the payable gold until an additional 157,330 oz of gold has been delivered (the \"Second Dropdown Threshold\"), at which point Wheaton will purchase 6.0% of payable gold for the life of the mine. Each of the First Dropdown Threshold and the Second Dropdown Threshold will be subject to adjustment if there are delays in deliveries relative to an agreed schedule, and commencing in 2033, if deliveries fall behind the agreed schedule by 10 Koz or more, the stream percentage will be increased by 5% until deliveries catch up with the agreed schedule. The applicable stream percentage will be reduced by half with respect to gold production from certain claims comprising the Interlake deposit. Payable gold is calculated using a fixed payable factor of 99.95%. Production Profile 1 : Attributable Gold Stream production is forecast to average approximately 20 Koz of gold per annum for the first 10 full years of production, and over 17 Koz per annum for the life of mine. The Hemlo Mine is forecast to have a 14-year mine life, with significant brownfield exploration potential near existing underground infrastructure. Production Payments: Wheaton will make ongoing payments for the gold ounces delivered equal to 20% of the spot price of gold. Incremental Reserves and Resources [1] : The addition of the Hemlo Mine will increase Wheaton's total estimated Proven and Probable Mineral gold reserves by 0.25 million ounces (\"Moz\"), Measured and Indicated Mineral gold resources by 0.08 Moz and Inferred gold resources by 0.04 Moz. Other Considerations: Wheaton will obtain a right of first refusal on any future precious metal streams, royalties, prepays or similar transactions with respect to the Hemlo Mine. HMC will provide Wheaton with corporate guarantees, as well as first-priority security interests on substantially all of HMC's assets on a shared basis with the lenders under the Acquisition Facility. HMC is expected to comply in all material respects with the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management, the Towards Sustainable Mining Standard, and Wheaton's Partner/Supplier Code of Conduct, which outlines Wheaton's expectations in regard to environmental, social and governance (\"ESG\") matters. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025. Financing the Transactions As at June 30, 2025 , the Company had approximately $1.0 billion of cash on hand. Wheaton believes that, when combined with the liquidity available under its $2 billion revolving term loan and ongoing operating cash flows, it is well positioned to fund the acquisition of the Gold Stream. This financial position supports outstanding commitments and known contingencies, while providing flexibility to pursue additional accretive mineral stream interests. About Carcetti/HMC and the Hemlo Mine Carcetti Capital Corp. is a Canadian-listed investment firm, headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia . Upon closing, Carcetti is to be re-named Hemlo Mining Corp. and will be led by an experienced leadership team with a long history and deep understanding of Hemlo . The Hemlo mine has produced approximately 25 million ounces of gold, and has been operating continuously for more than 30 years. Located just north of Lake Superior on the Trans-Canada Highway, about 35 kilometres east of Marathon, Ontario , it's currently an underground operation and has long been considered a cornerstone of Canada's mining sector. Previously under the ownership of Barrick Mining Corporation, Hemlo transitioned from an open pit operation to an underground operation in October 2020 .

            "Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Paul Atkins said Wednesday (Sept. 9) that “crypto’s time has come.”In a speech delivered at the inaugural OECD Roundtable on Global Financial Markets in Paris, Atkins said that while the SEC had set policy by “ad hoc enforcement actions” in the past, it will now provide “clear, predictable rules of the road.”Atkins pointed to the SEC’s Project Crypto and said one of its priorities is to provide certainty around the security status of crypto assets.“Most crypto tokens are not securities, and we will draw the lines clearly,” Atkins said in his speech. “We must ensure that entrepreneurs can raise capital on-chain without endless legal uncertainty. And we must allow for ‘super-app’ trading platform innovation that increases choice for market participants.”Atkins added that there should be a single regulatory umbrella for the trading, lending and staking that may be offered by platforms.During his speech, Atkins also addressed agentic finance, in which artificial intelligence agents execute trades, allocate capital and manage risk while adhering to securities law compliance.These systems could deliver “immense” benefits such as faster markets, lower costs and broader access to strategies, Atkins said.The government’s role in this technology is to maintain “commonsense guardrails” while eliminating “regulatory obstructions,” he said.“On-chain capital markets and agentic finance are on the horizon, and the world is watching,” Atkins said. “The choice before us is simple yet profound: either America steps forward with confidence and conviction, or others will. I choose leadership, freedom and growth — for our markets, for our economy, and for the next generation.”Atkins announced the launch of Project Crypto on July 31, saying this SEC-wide initiative aims to modernize securities rules and regulations to enable financial markets in the U.S. to move on-chain.On Sept. 2, the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said in a joint statement that SEC- and CFTC-registered exchanges are not prohibited from facilitating the trading of certain spot crypto asset products.Three days later, on Sept. 5, the two regulators said that they aim to harmonize their regulations to provide markets with clarity and bolster the strength of America’s capital markets.The post SEC Chairman Paul Atkins Says ‘Crypto’s Time Has Come’ appeared first on PYMNTS.com. \n",

Stephen Poloz says the economies of both Canada and the United States are headed for a recession. Read unlimited articles for free today: Already have an account? Opinion Stephen Poloz says the economies of both Canada and the United States are headed for a recession. In an interview with CTV News on Tuesday, the former Bank of Canada governor characterized the situation facing the two nations as “not a positive one,” adding that “What we’ve got is two economies, actually, that are sliding, let’s say, not in recession, probably, but sliding in that direction.” There is plenty of evidence in support of Poloz’s concern, beginning with poor job numbers. Last week, it was revealed that Canada’s unemployment rate rose to 7.1 per cent in July, while the nationwide rate among youth is more than twice that high, at a staggering 14.5 per cent. Poloz suggests that the rising use of artificial intelligence technology may have contributed to the higher jobless rate, but he also admits that “fundamentally, the backbone of the economy is weakening” in Canada. The same is also unfolding in America, where the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump’s reckless economic policies — most notably his imposition of tariffs on imports from dozens of nations, including Canada — are beginning to have a negative impact on the American economy. It was reported last week that, for the first time in several years, more Americans are looking for jobs than there are job vacancies in the United States. Similarly, it was revealed last Friday that just 22,000 new jobs had been created in the U.S. in July, putting the U.S. jobless rate at its highest since 2021. To make matters even worse, economists at the U.S. Federal Reserve are predicting that inflation in the U.S. will rise by 3.2 per cent over the next 12 months, which will cause many products and services to be more even expensive for those already burdened by affordability issues. That’s bleak news, but there appear to be two flickering lights of optimism in the economic data from both sides of the border. That brightness may be a mirage, however. First, the stock market has achieved a number of record highs since Trump’s inauguration last January. That has create the perception of prosperity, but the market’s rise appears to be linked to the assumption that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates, which will stimulate the U.S. economy. If those rate cuts do not materialize — if the Fed instead keeps the rate high in order to fight inflation — the markets could see a sharp drop. A second encouraging sign is that retail spending in Canada has remained steady despite the economic uncertainty caused by Trump’s tariffs, while U.S. consumer spending also continues to be strong. That may appear to be good news, but much of that spending is being financed with credit cards, and there are dark storm clouds on the horizon. It was recently reported that both Canadians and Americans are carrying record levels of credit card debt, with a large percentage of those consumers being at high risk of being unable to make their payments. If that happens — if millions of Canadians and Americans fall into debt default, resulting in a rapid reduction in consumer spending — both nations’ economies will be in deep trouble, with no quick or easy solution at hand. All of that troubling information underscores the daunting, dangerous economic challenge facing the Carney government in Ottawa, as well as each of the provincial and territorial governments. It points to the urgent importance of working to quickly form a new economic relationship with the United States — including a renegotiated Canada-U.S.-Mexico trade agreement — while also building stronger trading and security relationships with other nations around the world. It emphasizes the necessity that national projects capable of building a stronger, more resilient Canadian economy be identified by those governments and implemented as soon as possible. Most of all, the data tells all Canadians that we must be ready for the economic anxiety and pain that may be coming. We may hope for the best, but we each must prepare ourselves, our families and our communities for the tough challenges that lie ahead. Advertisement Advertisement \n",

            "On the weekend, warned that Australia must resist the “delusion” of building sovereign AI.With all due respect, Richard – you’ve missed the mark.Let’s start with where we agree. The machinery of government is not built to design and deploy cutting-edge technology like artificial intelligence. Innovating at speed requires the kind of culture and capability that governments, by design, usually lack. In that sense, no, the Commonwealth should not be building foundational AI models itself.But here’s where the argument falls down. To suggest that because Australia can’t outspend OpenAI, Anthropic or Google, we therefore shouldn’t bother building sovereign capability is to fundamentally misunderstand the opportunity. By that logic, we should collapse our military because we can’t outgun the United States or China.This isn’t about chasing Silicon Valley dollars or glamour projects – it’s about national resilience. If we shrug and rely entirely on others, we’re effectively outsourcing the foundations of our economy, education system and even our defence planning to offshore providers who don’t share our priorities.Sovereign AI is not about competing with Silicon Valley on scale or glamour. It is about creating a trusted, transparent and sovereign alternative that reflects Australian values, privacy standards, and ethical benchmarks. That’s it.Today, Australians in schools, hospitals, banks and law firms are already using AI built offshore, trained on foreign data, and subject to foreign laws. We have no visibility of what data these models were trained on, how that data was acquired, or whether biases were embedded in the process. Worse, we can’t even be sure where our own data flows once it’s fed into them.It’s like building a house, but instead of laying your own foundation, you ask your neighbour to extend theirs. It works for a while until cracks appear. When you try to fix the damage, you discover you don’t know what materials were used or how stable the ground really is. That’s what relying entirely on offshore models looks like.If we want teachers, doctors and business leaders to embrace AI, they need to know the systems they rely on are trustworthy and trained on Australian-relevant data, and inferenced onshore where the data never leaves our jurisdiction. Without that trust, adoption will stall.It doesn’t take billions to create sovereign AI. China’s DeepSeek model reportedly cost as little as $6 million to train (even if you assume some creative accounting, perhaps $30m). Australia could build a capable sovereign model for under $100m – a tiny fraction of what Holden suggests.And in fact, this is no longer hypothetical. This week, my co-founder Troy Neilson and I launched , an ethics-driven venture that has already made the single largest investment in AI infrastructure in the country.Some AI processes will always be better served using global models. But where Australians want transparency, sovereignty and trust, we must have a homegrown option. We’ve acquired 256 NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs (the nation’s biggest cluster) and committed $10 million to compensate copyright holders whose data is used in training. That means creators are rewarded, and Australians can see exactly how their models are built.Some AI processes will always be better served using global models. But where Australians want transparency, sovereignty and trust, we must have a homegrown option. This is not about the government building AI. It’s about enabling Australian-led ventures to ensure we don’t sleepwalk into a future where our values, ethics and data sovereignty are an afterthought.Keep in mind too that LLMs are used in so many applications. Recently, the Australian Financial Review published a story on Almost every single one of these would be calling on an LLM as part of their solution. Searching information or customer records? LLMs! Writing divorce agreements and wills? LLMs. And most importantly, transcribing medical notes for doctors? Yes. LLMs. Do we really want our doctors sharing our information with an offshore AI provider? That use case alone mandates sovereign capability.A model is not a science project. It is national infrastructure. Built properly, it will reflect our values, protect our data, and earn the public trust that is essential for adoption. \n",

            "In the fast-evolving world of software development, where artificial intelligence has become an indispensable tool for coding, a sudden outage can feel like a trip back to the Stone Age. On Wednesday, developers across the globe found themselves grappling with a major disruption when Anthropic, the AI company behind the popular Claude model, experienced a complete service blackout. The outage, lasting around half an hour, knocked out access to Claude.ai, its API, the code interpreter, and the management console, leaving programmers unable to leverage the AI for tasks like code generation and debugging. Social media erupted with frustration and humor as coders lamented the loss. Posts on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) captured the sentiment, with one developer quipping that without AI assistance, they were “coding like cavemen,” resorting to manual methods and basic tools. This incident, detailed in a report from Ars Technica , underscores a growing dependency on AI services that, when interrupted, exposes vulnerabilities in modern workflows. The Ripple Effects of AI Dependency The Anthropic outage isn’t an isolated event in 2025’s tech ecosystem. Earlier this year, similar disruptions hit major players like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, with global outages reported in June and September, as chronicled in analyses from Goover AI . These failures affected millions, from individual developers to enterprises relying on AI for real-time code assistance. In one instance, ChatGPT’s downtime on September 3 led to widespread complaints, with users turning to alternatives amid blank responses and error messages, according to coverage in TechGig. For industry insiders, these incidents highlight a critical risk: overreliance on centralized AI providers. A study published by METR in July revealed that while early-2025 AI tools promised productivity boosts, they actually slowed experienced open-source developers by 19% when integrated into workflows. The research, conducted as a randomized controlled trial, suggested that AI’s benefits are often offset by integration challenges and, crucially, service instability. Developer Reactions and Adaptation Strategies Amid the Anthropic blackout, developers shared coping strategies online, with some joking about dusting off old textbooks or reverting to “caveman coding” sans AI crutches. This humor masks a deeper concern, as noted in discussions on Slashdot , where anonymous readers debated the fragility of AI-dependent development. One key takeaway from X posts by figures like Ethan Mollick emphasized the need for “hotswappable” AI APIs—systems that allow seamless switching between providers like Anthropic and competitors such as Azure OpenAI or Together AI during outages. Enterprises are taking note. The June 2024 trifecta of failures involving ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity, as analyzed in Goover AI’s report, prompted calls for better redundancy. Developers are increasingly advocating for hybrid setups, incorporating on-premises AI models or diversified cloud services to mitigate risks. Sam Altman’s April post on X about OpenAI’s capacity challenges further illustrates the scaling pains, with delays and slowdowns becoming commonplace as demand surges. Broader Implications for AI Infrastructure Looking ahead, these outages raise questions about the sustainability of AI’s role in development. A post by Ankur Goyal on X highlighted technical hurdles like async execution and secure code runtime that serverless providers must address for AI’s future viability. Meanwhile, DFINITY Foundation’s commentary pointed to traditional IT stacks as ill-suited for AI, prone to breaches and slow upgrades. As AI integrates deeper into coding pipelines, insiders predict a push toward decentralized or edge-based solutions to avoid single points of failure. The Anthropic incident, while brief, serves as a stark reminder: in a field where innovation moves at breakneck speed, even short disruptions can halt progress, forcing a reevaluation of how we build resilient tech ecosystems. With more outages likely as AI adoption grows, developers may need to blend cutting-edge tools with timeless fundamentals to thrive. \n",

            "Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks remain some of the biggest investment opportunities out there for investors. After all, these are companies that are part of the future, but in more ways than answering your day-to-day questions on ChatGPT.In fact, AI is the future in one of the most important areas: supply chain management. Remember when we couldn’t get a hold of practically anything during the pandemic? That’s supply chain management. Supply chains were bogged down, and companies like Kinaxis (TSX:KXS) were there to help, even training smaller companies in how to manage them effectively. Today, the company has even more opportunities, so let’s get into them.About KXSFirst, let’s look at this supply-chain management company a bit further. Kinaxis is a Canadian software company based in Ottawa. While a Canadian company, it operates on a global scale, helping businesses anticipate disruptions, streamline operations, and make better business decisions.How does it do that? This is where AI comes in. Kinaxis stock has a RapidResponse platform. This powers concurrent planning, instantly recalculating supply, demand, inventory and more for any data changes. It also evolved this platform into Maestro, an AI-driven, end-to-end tool that spans from sales to operations and control towers for real-time execution.What’s more, it’s not some small businesses latching onto Kinaxis. The company boasts deals with Ford, Cisco, Qualcomm and more. These are recurring revenue streams usually lasting between two and five years. And what’s more, the company never has more than 5% of its company taken up by one business. That makes it safe and secure for today’s investor.Into earningsThis power can be seen in the company’s earnings. Kinaxis stock recently reported strong earnings for the second quarter; in fact, its strongest second quarter ever! Revenue jumped 15% to $136.4 million. This included a 17% increase in software-as-a-service (SaaS) revenue and a huge 270% jump in subscription term licenses.What’s more, gross profit went up 64%, showing the strength of its subscription business. As the company started deploying more AI capabilities, the AI stock is looking to attract even more business. This helped the decision in its 2025 guidance, projecting revenue between $535 and $550 million, and SaaS growth between 13% and 15%. Yet amongst all this, Kinaxis stock still holds value. Yes, its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio at 157.7 is very high. Yet the growth potential for this company is immense. It offers the unique position of growth in AI, while also providing the security and stability of a supply stock.Bottom lineNew investors will love this AI stock. Not just for growth in the next year or two, but for decades to come. It’s an AI stock that offers immense wealth for those patient enough to hold onto it. And trust me, you’ll want to hold onto it for years to come. So forget the AI stocks that promise quick growth.

            "Has France banned child beauty pageants? This is from 2013It was, indeed, gratifying to have parents, especially mothers, contacting me and praising The Island for the article ‘Negative impact on schoolchildren; An eye-opener for Women’s & Child Ministry’.What’s more, even AI (Artificial Intelligence) picked up the article and elaborated on it on AI Mode, and this is what AI created, with the headline ‘Negative impact on schoolchildren; An eye-opener for Women’s & Child Ministry’:“According to an article in The Island, a Sri Lankan newspaper, the potential negative impacts of child beauty pageants on schoolchildren should be an eye-opener for the country’s Women and Child Ministry. The article highlights concerns over the effects of intense competition on young children, calling for action from the Ministry and other authorities.‘Negative impact on schoolchildren; An eye-opener for Women’s & Child Ministry’ (The Island, Thursday, 04 September, 2025) highlighted on AI ModeThe article identifies several potential negative effects of child beauty pageants, fuelled by intense competition and pressure to win.* Mental health issues: Critics argue that the events can contribute to anxiety, depression, and stress.* Low self-worth: Placing high-value on physical appearance can lead to feelings of low self-worth in young participants.* Exploitation: The article implicitly raises concerns about potential harm and the need to protect children from exploitation.A Call For ActionThe author urges the Women’s and Child Ministry to take immediate action to address these pressing issues, emphasising the following:* Collaboration: Authorities must work together to ensure the protection and well-being of Sri Lankan schoolchildren.* Parental vigilance: Parents are reminded that their child’s safety is their responsibility and that they must remain cautious.* Regulatory focus: The piece mentions a global trend towards stricter regulations and increased awareness regarding the negative impact of such events on children.Swimwear now creepinginto teen pageantsThe article serves as a call for increased awareness and regulation surrounding child beauty pageants to protect the mental and emotional health of young participants.”And ... since these two letters make interesting reading, I thought of highlighting them, as well:Mrs. Somasundera: There are parents who put too much pressure on their children to win. Some of these kids hate doing pageants and are scared to go on stage, but the mothers force them out there, anyway. Obviously, these pageant mothers are more concerned about themselves than they are about their child’s happiness. They’re not entering pageants for the kids—they’re doing it for themselves. Mrs. Gamage: I do not support pageants for school-goers and I would never put my child in one. In my honest opinion, pageants for school-goers, and also modelling, are harmful to children. \n",

            "Fluminense is the first semifinalist of the 2025 Copa do Brasil. After losing in Salvador by 1-0, the Rio team defeated Bahia 2-0 on Wednesday night (10th) at Maracanã. With a decisive goal from captain Thiago Silva, 40 years old and champion of the 2007 edition with Flu under Renato Gaúcho. Fluminense secured its sixth appearance in the tournament’s semifinals and a prize of R$ 9.9 million in front of 48,669 attendees. And now faces a Rio derby semifinal against Botafogo or Vasco. Flu tries, but... The defeat in Salvador forced the home team to chase a goal from the start. They had more possession (about 70%). But failed to produce enough with the ball in the first half. They posed some threat with Thiago Silva in the air and managed two shots on target—but both were no trouble for Ronaldo. And that was it. Bahia, on the other hand, struggled to launch counterattacks. Their transition was slow. They succeeded in controlling the opponent’s momentum, playing in a 5-4-1 without the ball. Deserved by the hosts Flu came back with Acosta, putting an end to the three defensive midfielders. Bahia, meanwhile, brought on Sanabria in place of the booked and so far ineffective Kayky. Renato Gaúcho was more successful, as the diminutive Acosta made the difference by winning the penalty committed by Michel Araújo. Canobbio converted (55') to level the aggregate score. Soon after, Iago made a hard tackle on Thiago Silva. Fluminense—with anxiety at many moments—aimed to \"settle\" the match in regulation time. Meanwhile, Bahia continued to struggle to create. Then Thiago Silva, who had already tried three times, finally scored after a set piece with no chance for Ronaldo (84’). Trailing on aggregate, Bahia went all out. But for the ninth time, they were stopped in the Copa do Brasil quarterfinals. They still haven’t reached the semis. What now❓ Fluminense awaits the winner of the Botafogo vs Vasco clash. The first leg ended in a 1-1 draw. The return match will be this Thursday (11th) at Nilton Santos. The Copa do Brasil semifinals will only be played in December, after the end of the Brasileirão. The scheduled dates are December 10 and 14. Flu and Bahia now turn their focus to the Brasileirão. On Saturday (13th), the Rio team (9th) will host Corinthians (12th) at Maracanã. And on Monday (15th), the Bahia team (4th) will host Cruzeiro (2nd). Photo: Marcelo Gonçalves/Fluminense This article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

            "Former JPMorgan strategist Marko Kolanovic can be as bearish as they come, so it’s no surprise that he would greet the news that Oracle shares surged a staggering 36 per cent on Wednesday night with scepticism.Nevertheless, he delivered one of lines of the day in response , which one analyst pointed out was larger than the value of all but 42 companies in the S&P 500, including that icon of US capitalism, Disney.“Drawing one fairytale chart out of thin air is more worth than Disney drawing their fairytales and cartoons for over 100 years,” Kolanovic posted on social media.The fairytale chart to which he refers is the one that shows the projected revenue growth in Oracle’s cloud infrastructure business over the next four years: from $US18 billion in its 2026 financial year that will end next August to $US144 billion in the 2029 financial year.The sheer precision of those numbers is what’s baffled Kolanovic and many others. Four weeks is a long time in business right now, and a hell of a lot can happen over four years. Can Oracle investors really have faith in those projections?Apparently, they can. When Oracle’s first quarter numbers came out after the market closed on Tuesday night, The fact the gain in the official trade turned out to be even bigger than this is extraordinary. It suggests fear of missing out only snowballed as investors of all shapes and sizes digested the bullish projections.Record-breaking gainIt’s the biggest one-day gain for a company with a market capitalisation of more than $US500 million. It also catapulted Oracle’s 81-year-old co-founder and major shareholder, Larry Ellison, to the title of the world’s richest person, with a fortune of $US383 billion.However you look at it, this is a moment. But whether it’s a moment that marks the next stage of the artificial intelligence boom, or a moment that marks the peak of the AI bubble, is something investors need to think very carefully about.After the market closed on Wednesday night, investors did get more evidence on the scale of Oracle’s growth. News broke in The Wall Street Journal of its new deal with OpenAI, under which Oracle will provide the maker of ChatGPT with $US300 billion in computing power over roughly five years. This helps explain the $US317 billion increase in contracted revenue that Oracle reported a day earlier, which got everyone so excited. Its forward contract bookings now stand at $US455 billion.But is this the proof point the market thinks it is? Clearly, Oracle is enjoying a hell of a lot of demand, but most of this demand is coming from a small group of customers, and one customer in particular, in OpenAI.And yes, OpenAI has a valuation of $US500 billion, making it one of the most valuable start-ups on the planet. And yes, its revenue is growing like wildfire, up from $US4 billion a year ago to a projected $US13 billion this calendar year. But this is a company that is a long way from being profitable. So it will probably need investors to keep backing it with fresh capital. And what will those investors require? The promise of bigger and bigger gains from the AI boom.The AI money-go-roundDepending on your view, the deal with OpenAI is another example of the money-go-round that AI depends on. We know that a – led by Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon and Alphabet – is driving the capital expenditure boom across the industry. It is turbocharging the revenues of an even smaller group of companies – led by chipmaker Nvidia and large language model providers such as OpenAI – that sell the key ingredients for AI.But for Oracle, the flow of money is even more circular. It buys chips from Nvidia to build its cloud infrastructure on, and then rents that cloud infrastructure back to Nvidia and other players such as OpenAI, so they can keep developing products to sell to the hyperscalers. And these hyperscalers, of course, also need to rent more computing capacity from Oracle to run the next generation of products from Nvidia and OpenAI. Which forces Oracle to buy more chips from Nvidia to build more cloud infrastructure...and on it goes.Oracle’s OpenAI deal also raises some basic questions that investors seem happy to completely ignore, at least for now. The new computing power OpenAI is renting will reportedly require 4.5 gigawatts of power capacity, roughly comparable to the amount consumed by 4 million homes. What will this cost to build, even if it can be built?Indeed, the one note of concern from analysts about Oracle’s incredible revenue projections is that its free cashflow generation has already slumped, and the profit margins on its cloud infrastructure business are already in the single digits, and could be negative in some instances. Analyst Gil Luria, of brokerage DA Davidson, suggests Oracle’s earnings growth could stay in the single digits even as revenue accelerates.Clearly, investors are more than happy to look past this for the moment. This AI boom is all about momentum, about keeping up with the arms race, about betting that you can win the land grab before someone else does. Profit is a worry for another day.Perhaps that’s fair enough, but it elevates the risk for investors. If anything interrupts the AI investment boom – doubts about the productivity gains from AI, for example, or competition from Chinese competitors to the likes of Nvidia and OpenAI – then there are a lot of dominoes to fall.Is history repeating?Nick Ferres, chief investment officer at macro fund Vantage Point Asset Management, points out that Oracle’s shares have risen about 200 per cent in the past four years, while its earnings are actually down. He says this latest episode reminds him of the famous quotes in 2002 from former , who challenged investors on how far they pushed up valuations during the dotcom boom.“At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100 per cent of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends,” McNealy said. “That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate.“Do you realise how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don’t need any transparency. You don’t need any footnotes. What were you thinking?”Where does the US tech sector trade now? Ten times revenue, of course.Of course, there’s one big problem for investors in all this. The AI boom is getting bubbly, but who wants to miss the big gains? Any fund manager who was underweight Oracle is going to be cursing today, and tomorrow and all year, when they fail to beat their benchmark. As Ferres says, this boom can keep defying logic.“We are sympathetic to the positive feedback loop extending into next year if capital spending from the hyper-scalers continues,” he says. “However, AI spending has created a spiralling cost model. From a big picture perspective, if AI becomes cheaper, requires less power than previously thought, proliferates faster, or does not generate a sufficient return on capital to meet investor expectations, then existing capital spending outlays could be very wrong.“Euphoric non-linear price action combined with heroic valuation is a warning signal that the trend is mature.” \n",

            "The centre has already started studies in four disaster-sensitive districts in Himachal Pradesh – Shimla, Dharamshala, Mandi, and Kullu Himalayan Centre for Disaster Risk Reduction and Resilience of Himachal Pradesh University (HPU) is planning to combine artificial intelligence (AI) with conventional local knowledge for developing a futuristic early warning system for natural disasters in Himachal and the Himalayan region. The centre has already started studies in four disaster-sensitive districts in Himachal Pradesh – Shimla, Dharamshala, Mandi, and Kullu. “The initiative aims to mitigate the impact of climate change and global warming by integrating advanced scientific research, community wisdom and policy-level outreach,” said Dr Mahesh Sharma, deputy director of Himalayan Centre for Disaster Risk Reduction and Resilience (HIM-DR3) HPU vice-chancellor professor Mahavir Singh, said, “The main objective of this centre is to take research from campus to community and up to the policy level. We will incorporate AI and local community knowledge not only to develop an early warning system but also to introduce disaster mitigation and reduction courses in universities, colleges, and schools.” The centre has partnered with Norway’s Norwegian Geotechnical Institute (NGI) and Italy’s University of Padua to conduct studies using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technology for monitoring hazards. V-C Mahavir added that Himachal Pradesh State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA), the National Disaster Management Institute (Government of India), and international partners have already approved collaborative agreements. “We will organise training programmes and workshops in disaster-hit or sensitive districts, and also bring community representatives to our campus for awareness. Data accuracy is crucial whether from NASA or satellite-based systems and AI tools will help us pinpoint specific local vulnerabilities, such as why land is sinking or frequent landslides occur,” he said. HPU is also working with the Himachal Pradesh education department to integrate localised disaster-related content into school curricula, building upon NCERT’s existing disaster education modules. Prof. Mahavir said the centre aims to become a landmark institution for tackling climate change impacts, disaster risk mitigation, and promoting sustainable, eco-friendly technologies. “In the next 8–9 months, we expect to reach a stage where specific data can be shared with both government and the public for early warnings. This will save lives and reduce losses in the Himalayan region,” he said. Scientist and assistant professor Sansar Raj Meena, a researcher at the University of Patova, Italy, said his team will bring advanced AI and machine learning expertise to the project. “We work on slope stability, predictive modelling and remote sensing data analysis for landslide risk detection. The Himalayas are vast, so we use satellite, LiDAR, UAV, and drone data for hazard mapping,” Meena said. He stressed that scientific reports must be written in accessible language for government officials to act upon. He said, “In developing countries, reports often remain unused because officials don’t understand the technical content. We need willingness from governments to work with research institutions and local communities to implement disaster preparedness tools.” Himachal Pradesh University Climate Change \n",

            "By your mid-40s, many Australians are at peak financial pressure. Mortgages, school fees, and the rising cost of living squeeze household budgets, while superannuation can slip to the back of the priority list. Yet this is also a critical decade: the years where smart investing choices can turn average balances into retirement-changing sums. According to the Australian Retirement Trust, someone aged 45 should ideally have more than $225,000 in super to stay on track. The average balance, however, is often tens of thousands of dollars lower. The gap may feel daunting, but it highlights why the right portfolio mix matters more than ever. Core and satellite: A smarter frameworkThe core and satellite strategy gives structure to investing at this stage.The core: Broad, low-cost exposures â usually superannuation growth options or index ETFs. Think of funds like the Vanguard Australian Shares Index ETF (ASX: VAS) or the iShares S&P 500 ETF (ASX: IVV). These provide diversification, capture market returns, and keep fees to a minimum.The satellites: Higher-growth or thematic opportunities. This is where investors can tilt towards global technology leaders, emerging markets, or small-cap companies with room to expand. The aim isn't to gamble, but to complement the steady core with growth drivers that could boost long-term returns.At 45, you still have ~20 years of compounding left. Satellites are the accelerators, while the core is the engine. Together, they create balance and resilience.Topping up super in smarter waysSuperannuation remains the most tax-effective vehicle for retirement wealth, so topping it up can be a powerful move. Salary sacrifice and concessional contributions reduce taxable income while adding to your retirement savings. Even modest amounts compound significantly when left for two decades.However, the overlooked lever is where those super dollars are invested. Many Australians default into conservative or balanced options, which may limit growth. For someone in their mid-40s, a growth or high-growth allocation could capture more of the market's upside while there's still time to ride out volatility. Building wealth outside superWhile super is crucial, it's locked away until at least age 60. That's why building wealth outside super is equally important.ETFs offer a simple entry point. Beyond the ASX 200, investors can add robotics and artificial intelligence ETFs, or global defence ETFs, each linked to long-term megatrends. For those comfortable with more risk, small-cap shares can add growth potential. These companies are often under-researched and can deliver outsized returns if they execute well.And don't overlook alternative assets. Gold, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), or private credit funds may not form the bulk of a portfolio, but small allocations can provide diversification and a hedge against market shocks.Growth via asset selection and timeThe most powerful wealth driver at this stage isn't just how much you save; it's where you place it, and how long you let it grow.For example, a $20,000 investment compounded at 9.3% annually over 20 years grows to around $115,000. Add regular contributions â say $500 a month â and the portfolio can snowball into the hundreds of thousands.Warren Buffett captured it best: \"Someone is sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago.\" Your 40s are the perfect time to plant aggressively, letting growth assets compound while you still have time on your side.Foolish TakeawayThe average super balance at 45 might look underwhelming, but the next two decades can be transformational. By combining a core of broad-market investments with satellite allocations to growth sectors, global themes, and small caps, and by topping up super while also investing outside of it, Australians can reshape their retirement trajectory. At 45, you're not running out of time: you're entering the compounding sweet spot. The portfolio mix you choose today could be the difference between scraping by and enjoying the freedom of financial independence.

This evolution in search is driven by the need for speed, convenience, and personalized answers. However, with AI’s growing influence, key concerns remain, especially regarding misinformation, bias, and reliability in fields such as academia, finance, and law. As the role of AI in online search grows, it has sparked a debate: Can AI truly replace traditional search engines like Google?Changing User Behavior: Google Still Dominates, But AI Grows FastThe dominance of Google in search remains clear, with 86% of users still relying on it for information. However, there’s a rapid rise in AI-powered search tools, with 81% of users reporting they’ve used them in the past three months. While Google continues to reign supreme in terms of traditional search, platforms like ChatGPT have quickly become essential tools for information retrieval, particularly among younger generations. 63.6% of Gen Z and 68.5% of Millennials use AI search tools regularly, compared to just 46.25% of Boomers. This demographic shift reveals a growing adoption of AI, suggesting that younger users are increasingly abandoning traditional search in favor of faster, more intuitive AI systems.The Growing Influence of AI in Search: What Users PreferAs AI tools gain traction, many users find that they offer a better experience than Google in terms of speed and clarity. 45.5% of users claim AI-powered tools provide a superior experience, especially when it comes to generating clear answers without sifting through multiple links. With AI providing direct, concise answers, users are beginning to spend less time visiting websites directly. This behavioral shift is particularly noticeable among younger users, with 66% of participants reporting that AI tools have reduced their frequency of visiting websites. This decline in click-through behavior further highlights the rising reliance on AI-generated summaries that give users the information they need at a glance.The Generational Divide: Who’s Using AI the Most?AI search tools have seen widespread adoption among younger generations, with Gen Z and Millennials leading the charge. These groups are turning to AI not just for quick answers, but for deep explorations into topics, using it for everything from idea generation to summarization of complex content. While 81% of respondents have used AI tools like ChatGPT, the adoption rate is much lower among older generations. Just 46.2% of Boomers use AI frequently, and 12.3% have never used them. This divide underscores how AI has yet to penetrate certain demographic groups, suggesting that while the tools are growing in popularity, they aren’t yet ubiquitous across all age categories.Will AI Replace Traditional Search Engines?Despite its growing popularity, AI is not yet seen as a full replacement for traditional search engines. 56.1% of users view AI tools as a supplement to traditional search engines like Google rather than a complete replacement. Only 6.1% of respondents see AI tools as fully replacing Google. Most users still rely on traditional search engines for quick answers, with 68.3% choosing Google first for tasks like fact-checking or looking up simple queries. AI, however, shines when it comes to more complex or exploratory questions, such as brainstorming ideas or summarizing lengthy articles. Users are increasingly using AI tools as an extra layer to enhance their online search experience.AI’s Growing Role in Shopping Behavior and ResearchAI is not just changing how people search for information; it’s also transforming their purchasing decisions. Nearly 60% of users report using AI tools to research products or services before making a purchase.

Whether it’s finding product reviews, comparing prices, or getting personalized recommendations, AI is helping users make more informed choices. As these tools evolve, their influence in both research and commerce is expected to increase, further cementing their place in the online ecosystem.The Misinformation Challenge: Can AI Be Trusted?As AI tools gain traction, one of the main concerns users have is the accuracy of the information they provide. 61.6% of users report encountering misinformation or biased responses when using AI for search, raising questions about the reliability of AI-generated content. While AI excels at providing quick, concise answers, the lack of transparency and source attribution often leaves users questioning the accuracy of the information. In fact, 32.8% of users say they don’t trust AI-generated summaries as much as they trust content from original websites. This concern over misinformation is a key hurdle that AI developers must address to build long-term trust with users.AI Tools and the Decline of Click-Through SearchesOne of the most significant changes driven by AI search tools is the rise of zero-click searches. AI tools, especially those used for quick fact-finding or summarization, are increasingly providing users with answers directly on the platform, eliminating the need to click on external links. 52% of users report using AI-generated summaries without clicking through to external websites. Millennials and Gen Z, in particular, show the highest rates of zero-click behavior, with 60% of Millennials and 55% of Gen Z preferring to get all the information they need from AI tools alone. This shift in behavior is affecting the broader click ecosystem, as websites see less direct traffic from search engines.Trust and Transparency: The Key to AI AdoptionFor AI search tools to fully replace traditional engines like Google, users need confidence in their accuracy and reliability. A significant 61.6% of respondents cite misinformation as a major concern when using AI for search, with 55.4% specifically worried about “hallucinations” or inaccurate results. To address these concerns, AI tools must become more transparent, offering clear citations and sources for the information they provide. 68.3% of users say that clickable references or citations are essential for trusting AI-generated answers, particularly in fields like academia, where the stakes for accurate information are high.The Future of AI Search: What Lies Ahead?Despite the challenges, the future of AI-powered search looks promising. 50.5% of users believe that AI tools could fully replace traditional search engines like Google within the next five years. This shift may not happen overnight, but it indicates that users are ready for a more personalized, fast, and reliable way of searching the web. Creative industries, technology, and academia are already seeing the benefits of AI in enhancing search capabilities, with many professionals in these fields turning to AI tools for idea generation and research. Over time, as AI tools improve their accuracy and become more reliable, they may indeed become the new standard for search.Conclusion: The Hybrid Future of SearchIn the ongoing battle between AI and traditional search engines, it’s clear that both have their place. AI tools are revolutionizing how people search for and interact with information, offering a faster, more intuitive alternative to traditional search engines. However, Google still leads when it comes to speed and trust for quick answers. For now, AI is serving as a supplement to Google, enhancing the search experience for users while providing valuable insights, summaries, and creative outputs. As AI continues to improve, it may eventually become the default search tool for many users, especially as concerns around accuracy and bias are addressed.The post Now, ChatGPT Joins Perplexity, Claude, Bing AI, Grok, Copilot to Replace Traditional Search Engines like Google, Yahoo Within Five Years appeared first on Travel And Tour World. \n",

            "OpenAI today confirmed that it has signed an agreement to purchase computing infrastructure worth $300 billion from Oracle Corp. over a period of roughly five years, as part of its previously announced Project Stargate data center building initiative. The deal represents one of the biggest cloud contracts in history. It’s a massive commitment that far outstrips OpenAI’s current revenue, reflecting the frenzied rate of spending on artificial intelligence data centers by Silicon Valley companies. OpenAI and Oracle will construct 4.5 gigawatts of data center compute capacity, which is roughly equivalent to the electricity produced by more than two Hoover Dams, or the amount consumed by about 4 million U.S. homes, the Wall Street Journal reported today. The announcement came after Oracle’s stock surged by more than 42% on Wednesday after it reported adding $317 billion in future contract revenue during its latest quarter. Oracle Chief Executive Safra Catz told analysts on a conference call that her company had signed contracts with three customers, one of which we now know was OpenAI. The first hint of the deal came in June, when Oracle said in a regulatory filing it had agreed a cloud services agreement that would generate more than $30 billion in revenue in fiscal 2027. The revenue it receives will increase with each year, as more data center infrastructure comes online. OpenAI revealed one month later that it had agreed to purchase 4.5 gigawatts of compute power from Oracle, but did not disclose the size of the contract at that time. Project Stargate was announced at the White House in January, when OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Oracle founder and Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison (pictured) appeared alongside U.S. President Donald Trump, who said it was all about establishing American leadership in AI. The two partners initially pledged to build at least $100 billion worth of data centers, before expanding the effort to $500 billion in the “coming years.” OpenAI later confirmed that Stargate is the brand for all of its data center infrastructure initiatives, but has not revealed the specifics of that pact, which also involves the technology investor SoftBank Group Corp. After announcing Stargate, OpenAI has already secured commitment for more than half of $500 billion goal, and construction is already underway at a location in Abilene, Texas. The two companies aren’t the only big tech firms racing to build out AI data center facilities as fast as they can. Rivals that include Amazon Web Services Inc., Microsoft Corp., Google LLC and Meta Platforms Inc. have pledged to spend a combined $300 billion on building their own giant data centers this year. But OpenAI’s and Oracle’s venture may be perceived by some as somewhat more risky. OpenAI is very far from being profitable. On the contrary, it’s bleeding cash. In June it disclosed that it’s generating approximately $10 billion in annual revenue, which is less than a fifth of the $60 billion in expenses it will pay each year on building out data centers and renting compute capacity from other data center operators. Meanwhile, Oracle is betting a large chunk of its future revenue on just one customer. It will probably have to take on debt to fund the purchase of the AI chips needed in its planned data centers. Altman has already committed to a number of seemingly risky ventures. His company is also reportedly working with Broadcom Inc. to develop its own custom AI chips, and trying to build a device that will compete with Apple Inc.’s iPhone. The company, which has taken billions of dollars in funding, is burning through more money than pretty much any startup in history. Last year, Altman reportedly told investors he doesn’t expect OpenAI to become profitable until 2029 at the earliest, and will likely need to spend $44 billion to get there. As such, OpenAI’s and Oracle’s deal is a gamble that ChatGPT’s explosive growth will continue to accelerate and end up being used by billions of consumers and thousands of businesses globally. But it faces some serious competition from rivals such as Google and other AI startups such as Anthropic PBC, and it has an increasingly tense relationship with its main financial backer Microsoft. The Journal says Oracle has a much greater debt load relative to its cash holdings than Microsoft, Amazon and Meta. Its investments on AI infrastructure have already outpaced its cash flow, and it has a total debt-to-equity ratio of 427%, compared with just 32% for Microsoft. OpenAI and Oracle have also committed to a separate initiative that will see them build a massive data center complex in the United Arab Emirates, as part of a deal that was negotiated by Trump and that country’s government. It’s a joint venture that also involves SoftBank and the Emirati investment firm G42 and other stakeholders. However, G42 will contribute to the financing of OpenAI’s U.S. data centers too, the deal being that for every dollar it invests in the Emirates, it will spend an equivalent amount on U.S. data centers. \n",

            "Emma OkonjiZoho, a global technology company, recently released a new research report, which revealed that Nigerian businesses are setting a global standard in balancing Artificial Intelligence (AI) adoption with robust privacy protection.The study titled: ‘The AI Privacy Equation: The Nigerian Model of Responsible AI Adoption’, was conducted by Arion Research on behalf of Zoho.The company also said it saw a customer growth of 75 per cent in 2024 in Nigeria, one of its key markets in the African region.Zoho made the two key announcements on the sidelines of Zoholics Nigeria, the company’s annual user conference, which held recently in Lagos. Speaking at a press conference, Country Head, Zoho Nigeria, Mr. Kehinde Ogundare, said: “We continue to invest in Nigeria as businesses here accelerate their adoption of technology to grow and scale. The latest study around AI and Privacy proves that Nigerian businesses are leading the way in responsible AI adoption, as they temper the new technology with privacy measures. This mirrors Zoho’s philosophy of building contextual and privacy-first AI models that can help businesses realise tangible benefits. We infuse our AI solutions—from conversational and prescriptive to agentic and generative—with business context so that it can provide organisations with decision intelligence.”The report, which surveyed 386 respondents in Nigeria, reveals that 93 per cent of Nigerian organisations have already begun their AI journey, with 31 per cent achieving advanced AI integration across the organisation, and 26.5 per cent implementing AI across multiple departments. This indicates that more than half of Nigerian businesses have moved from an experimental phase to operational deployment of AI. Furthermore, 84 per cent of the respondents report strengthening privacy measures since implementing AI, with 66 per cent describing these improvements as significant, the report said.According to the report, the widespread adoption is being driven by executive commitment at the highest levels, as more than half of the respondents occupy CEO or executive roles, and this leadership-driven approach is accelerating adoption and moving companies quickly from pilots to full-scale deployment. The study found that Nigerian businesses are not just adopting AI, they are embedding it responsibly.The report further said 94 per cent of organisations now have a dedicated privacy officer or team, a figure well above global averages. “In fact, 40 per cent of the organisations allocate more than 30 per cent of their IT budgets specifically to privacy protection, reflecting the belief that strong governance is a competitive advantage rather than constraint,” the report further said.The financial sector, according to the report, is pioneering the balance between innovation and compliance, representing 29 per cent of the respondents. Their top AI use cases for them include customer service automation (49 per cent), software development and enhancement (46 per cent), and marketing optimisation (32 per cent), each implemented with privacy-by-design principles at the core. Addressing AI upskilling and barriers, the report said while the lack of technical expertise was cited as the top-most barrier by 37 per cent of the businesses, privacy and security concerns were the next biggest challenge, cited by 35 per cent of the respondents, adding that skills development is, therefore, a defining feature of the Nigerian model, with 69 per cent of organisations prioritising data analysis and interpretation skills, 53 per cent emphasising on AI literacy, and 40 per cent of organisations investing in prompt engineering skills for generative AI tools. The report noted that Nigerian organisations recognised that AI success depends more on human capability development than technology acquisition.

            "​​​Emma OkonjiThe International Telecommunications Union (ITU), the United Nations specialised agency for global digital technology development, has said it will cost an investment plan of between $2.6 and $2.8 trillion to achieve a universal and meaningful Internet connectivity by 2030, based on current market prices.ITU derived the whopping $2.8 trillion investment plan from a report it released recently in collaboration with the Communications, Space & Technology Commission (CST) of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.The report, titled: ‘Connecting Humanity Action Blueprint’, outlines the challenges, projected costs, and collaborative strategies needed to make sure everyone, everywhere, can use the Internet, including the estimated one-third of humanity currently offline. According to the report, the largest investment component of $1.5 trillion to $ 1.7 trillion is required for hard infrastructure, alongside substantial funding for human and institutional capacity, mainly in developing countries.Giving details of the report, ITU Secretary-General, Doreen Bogdan-Martin, said: “Digital connectivity means creating opportunities for education, jobs, and access to essential services that can transform lives and communities. While significant resources are needed to meaningfully connect everyone, these are investments that will contribute to a prosperous digital future for all.”Acting Governor of CST, Haytham AlOhali, said: “The world needs between $ 2.6 trillion and $ 2.8 trillion to connect humanity by 2030. This figure is nearly five times higher than the last assessment conducted in 2020 in partnership with ITU during the Saudi chairmanship of the G20. Such a dramatic increase underscores the urgency for international cooperation, collective investment, and the sharing of expertise if we are to achieve the vision of universal, meaningful connectivity for all.”Highlighting the challenges of connecting billions of people globally, ITU estimates that 2.6 billion people are still excluded from the digital world, with connectivity closely linked to levels of socio-economic development. In 2024, an estimated 93 per cent of the population in high-income countries was using the Internet, compared to just 27 per cent in low-income countries.The new report on achieving universal meaningful connectivity builds on ITU’s original 2020 Connecting Humanity study, published under the direction of the G20 during the presidency of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, by identifying critical gaps with the anticipated costs for addressing them. ​According to the report, a breakdown of the $2.8 trillion investment cost, shows that deploying broadband networks such as 4G fixed wireless in rural regions and satellites in the most remote locations and in underserved populations, represents the single largest cost of between $1.5 and $1.7 trillion.Affordability represents $983 billion to reduce the cost of smartphones and broadband services for both fixed and mobile, which according to the report, is vital so that individuals and households worldwide, particularly in lower-income regions, can afford to connect and stay online.Digital skills represents $152 billion to boost the effective use of the Internet, since connectivity alone is not enough, as people must have the skills to use the Internet effectively. Investments to fund large-scale digital literacy initiatives can empower individuals to access online education, secure better jobs, and actively participate in a digitally-driven society, the report said.Policy and regulation represents $ 600 million to modernise regulations and create predictable policy environments worldwide, that will unlock efficiencies and promote innovation. While this represents the smallest cost component, it holds back digital transformation and sustains the other gaps. The impact of closing it would be massive, according to the report.The report however said public-private collaboration would be needed to achieve the five-year investment plan on global Internet connectivity.As the ‘Connecting Humanity Action Blueprint’ highlights, global progress on connectivity has been uneven, with the world’s 46 least-developed countries lagging significantly due to financing barriers, limited technical expertise, and unreliable infrastructure.To address the challenges, ITU has called for innovative business approaches and renewed collaboration between governments, the tech industry, development finance institutions, and civil society, to close current divides and prevent future ones, particularly in fields like Artificial Intelligence (AI).The report recommended the use of schools as gateways to Internet access to accelerate digital inclusion worldwide, including investing in energy infrastructure in Africa, and enhancing data collection at the sub-national level.The post Report: Achieving Global Internet Connectivity by 2030 Will Require $2.8trn Investment appeared first on THISDAYLIVE. \n",

            "\"You can have anything you want in life if you dress for it,” Edit Head, an American film costume designer who won a record eight Oscars, once said. Unfortunately, this powerful statement applies less to some of us who work remotely. Working from the comfort of your home has numerous advantages, yet one of its shortcomings is dressing up. While one can argue that you can still dress up at home, we all know it's not the same. That’s why some people working from home enjoy every other opportunity, no matter how small, to carefully choose their outfits. Even people who don’t care about fashion have to think of it on special occasions, such as weddings and celebrations or just job interviews and important meetings. Fashion has a way of touching every one of us, at least gently. It comes as no surprise, then, that the fashion industry is one of the world’s biggest economic sectors. According to a report from Uniform Market, the global apparel market is estimated at $1.84 trillion and will account for 1.6% of the world’s GDP in 2025. Times are changing, and the fashion industry, despite its scope, is not immune to the trends and technological advancements. That’s why a world-famous fashion and lifestyle brand, Ralph Lauren (RL) , has teamed up with Microsoft (MSFT) on the launch of a new app. Ralph Lauren expands a decadeslong partnership with Microsoft to launch a new app. Image source: Ralph Lauren Ralph Lauren launches \"Ask Ralph\" appRalph Lauren announced Sept. 9 the launch of Ask Ralph, a new AI-powered conversational shopping app. The app was developed in a longstanding partnership with Microsoft on its Azure OpenAI platform using advanced conversational AI technology. The app relies on natural language processing and powerful AI to understand prompts, interpret context, and provide suitable recommendations. Related: Lululemon CEO raises red flag about customer behavior in storesThe idea behind Ask Ralph was to create an experience that vastly resembles the real one of speaking with an in-store stylist. Customers can interact with the app just as they would with a stylist in a Ralph Lauren store, asking simple questions such as: What should I wear to a concert? Show me some women’s Polo Bear sweaters.Then Ask Ralph answers with visuals, providing images of complete Polo Ralph Lauren looks with styling tips, integrating content from Ralph Lauren’s digital channels.

The app clearly aims to take clothes shopping from the comfort of your home to a whole other level — with stylist recommendations. Ask Ralph is already available for Ralph Lauren app users in the U.S. on Apple and Android devices.Ralph Lauren's Ask Ralph app highlights AI’s role in fashion industryWhile Ralph Lauren’s app seems like a breakthrough, it’s been a while since AI started transforming the fashion industry. However, what makes the Ask Ralph app special is the legacy of the 58-year-old fashion brand. AI’s role in the apparel space goes well beyond automation, according to a report by Sigma University. It can help “predict and forecast trends, understand consumer preferences, and generate design prototypes.” Related: Popular shoe retailer files unexpected Chapter 11 bankruptcyDesigners use AI to obtain insights into patterns and styles that do well with certain audiences, enhancing efficiency.

Ask Ralph app will see further refinementTo train the Ask Ralph model, Microsoft used both archived and newly collected data from Ralph Lauren to help define the brand’s unique aesthetic, according to a report from Fast Company. To make the app as authentic as possible, Ralph Lauren’s creative team, including designed and in-store stylists, took part. The beta version was reviewed by employees for feedback. “Whether you’re getting ready for a first day of a new job, or creating the perfect look for a night out, Ask Ralph is about more than just discovery — it is about engaging consumers with what they love most about Ralph Lauren: our iconic, unique take on style, providing timeless head-to-toe looks that inspire them to step into our world,” stated David Lauren, Chief Branding and Innovation Officer, Ralph Lauren Corporation.Ralph Lauren plans to continue to upgrade the app with new features and increased personalized experiences when it gets feedback from consumers.

            "Prolog Overview: History, Features, and ApplicationsAuthor: [Your Name]Date: October 4, 2023Reading Duration: Approximately 5 minutes Introduction to PrologProlog, short for “Programming in Logic,” is a high-level programming language primarily associated with artificial intelligence and computational linguistics. Its foundation lies in formal logic, which allows developers to express facts and rules about some domain of interest.Historical ContextProlog was conceived in the early 1970s, primarily developed by French computer scientist Alain Colmerauer. The language emerged from the desire to create a logical programming paradigm that could enable more powerful and flexible approaches to problem-solving compared to traditional procedural programming languages. The initial implementation was designed for natural language processing, and over the years, Prolog has evolved into a robust system used for a wide range of applications.The most significant development in Prolog can be traced to its standardization in the early 1980s with the introduction of the Edinburgh version, which served as a reference point for many implementations thereafter. Notable Prolog systems like SWI-Prolog and GNU Prolog have emerged, allowing developers to leverage the language’s capabilities across various platforms.Core Concepts and FeaturesProlog is centered around a few core concepts that distinguish it from other programming languages:1. Facts and RulesFacts are basic assertions about the world, represented in the form of predicates. For example, father(john, mary). asserts that John is the father of Mary.Rules define logical relationships between facts. For instance, a rule might state that grandfather(X, Y) :- father(X, Z), father(Z, Y). This rule defines what it means for one to be a grandfather.2. QueriesUsers can query the Prolog system to infer information based on the provided facts and rules. For example, asking ?- grandfather(john, X). prompts Prolog to resolve who X is, based on the defined relationships.3. BacktrackingProlog specializes in backtracking search, an integral feature that allows the language to explore multiple potential solutions to a problem. When the system encounters a failure in satisfying a query, it systematically re-evaluates previous decisions to find an alternative path.4. UnificationThe process of unification is fundamental in Prolog. It involves matching terms and substituting variables to find solutions. For example, the unification of father(X, Y) with father(john, mary) will produce X = john and Y = mary.Applications of PrologProlog’s logical programming paradigm lends itself to various applications, particularly in fields where complex relationships must be represented. Some prominent areas include:Artificial Intelligence: Prolog is commonly used in AI for expert systems, natural language processing, and theorem proving.Database Management: The language’s logical framework allows for complex queries and relationships to be modeled effectively, making it useful in knowledge bases and relational databases.Educational Purposes: Prolog is often utilized in teaching concepts of logic and computational thinking, offering students insights into the fundamentals of logic programming.Robotics: The logical constructs of Prolog are employed to define behaviors and manage knowledge in robotic systems, enhancing their decision-making capacities.ConclusionProlog remains a powerful tool in the world of programming, particularly in domains where logical reasoning and knowledge representation are crucial. Though other languages and paradigms have emerged over time, Prolog’s unique approach continues to find relevance in various fields, showcasing the enduring impact of its foundational concepts.As technology continues to advance, the principles behind Prolog will persist, inspiring future generations of programmers and researchers in their quest for intelligent systems.End of ArticleEstimated Reading Time: Approximately 5 minutes. \n",

            "Doha-based Rasmal Ventures, backed by the Qatar Investment Authority, invests US$2 million in Hong Kong’s Nexx A venture capital firm backed by Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund is taking a minority stake in an AI-powered logistics technology start-up backed by Hong Kong’s wealthiest man, as it looks for investment opportunities in the Greater China region to more than triple its assets under management by the end of 2025. Doha-based Rasmal Ventures, backed by the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), has invested US$2 million (HK$15.6 million) in Hong Kong’s Nexx , an 18-month-old start-up backed by Li Ka-shing’s flagship CK Asset Holdings. Rasmal will get a seat on the board of Nexx, which uses generative artificial intelligence (AI) to help warehouses reduce costs and improve efficiency, said Soumaya Ben Beya Dridje, a partner at the firm. “We are a lead investor in this round,” said Ben Beya Dridje during an interview in Hong Kong. “This is only the beginning. It’s the first check. Once they grow a little bit more, they will be in better terms to raise more funds, and we will definitely follow on in the next round with more capital once they check some other milestones.” Nexx, co-founded and chaired by former JPMorgan banker Houston Huang , will provide its AI solutions to help Qatar Navigation Q.P.S.C., also known as Milaha, undertake semi- and fully automated warehousing operations, particularly in picking, sorting, forecasting and order fulfilment. The use of Nexx’s solution will enhance Milaha’s operational efficiency, predictive inventory planning, order accuracy and staff productivity, paving the way for a smart and scalable logistics model, the company said. Nexx’s clients include Hong Kong-based KLN Logistics Group and mainland home appliance manufacturer Gree Electric. Rasmal’s assets were valued at US$30 million last year. The group is targeting a fund with assets of between US$70 million and US$100 million by the end of 2025, Ben Beya Dridje added. \n",

            "A parliamentary committee urges the Indian government to define fake news legally, balancing misinformation control with free speech protection. New Delhi: A parliamentary committee has pressed the Union government to come up with a clear legal definition of fake news, which it stressed was a threat to public order and democratic process, arguing that the absence of a uniform definition makes the term vague and open to misuse. In a draft report, the Standing Committee on Communications and Information Technology has noted that while stakeholders such as the Editors Guild of India, News Broadcasters and Digital Association, and leading media houses differed on how the term should be framed, the ministry of information and broadcasting (MIB) should evolve a “subtle but clear” definition that balances the need to curb misinformation with the protection of free speech. The committee, headed by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lawmaker Nishikant Dubey, adopted the draft report on Tuesday and submitted it to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla. “Yesterday, our parliamentary committee passed a report and submitted it to the Lok Sabha Speaker, proposing struct rules, punishment provisions, and bans for those spreading such malicious propaganda, fake news, and using artificial intelligence to push agendas against women and children on news platforms, Facebook, YouTube, and X,” Dubey said in a post in Hindi on X, pointing out that Parliament is not currently in session. The draft report, reviewed by HT, also recommended MIB to explore the feasibility of giving statutory powers to the Fact Check Unit (FCU) under the Press Information Bureau (PIB) to act against misinformation related to government schemes and initiatives. Data presented to the panel showed the FCU received over 163,000 queries between April 2020 and April 2025, of which only around 53,000 were found relevant. To be sure, the FCU does not have enforcement powers and it functions only to verify and flag contents. The push for statutory powers follows a legal setback in September last year, when the Bombay high court struck down Rule 3(1)(b)(v) of the amended IT Rules, 2021. The provision had required platforms to take down content flagged as “fake” or “misleading” by a government-appointed FCU. The high court ruled it unconstitutional and violative of fundamental rights, including Articles 14 (right to equality), and 19(1)(a) (freedom of speech and expression). Beyond fact-checking, the panel has called for an independent central monitoring body with representatives from MIB, the ministry of electronics and information technology (MeitY), media organisations, and other stakeholders to decide on cross-platform fake news cases and recommend penalties. It has also proposed the formation of an expert group to suggest amendments to existing laws, including the IT Act, 2000 and the Cable Television Network (Regulation) Act, 1995, to better address misinformation. To strengthen self-regulation, the committee has asked MIB to make fact-checking mechanisms and internal ombudsmen mandatory across all print, digital, and electronic media outlets. It has also flagged that current penalties for fake news are weak, with broadcasters facing fines capped at ₹ 25 lakh, suspension, or cancellation of licences only in extreme cases. It has recommended higher fines and clear accountability for editors, publishers, intermediaries, and platforms. Stressing the importance of fighting misinformation to safeguard democracy, the draft report also cautioned that such efforts must be balanced with constitutional guarantees of free speech and press freedom. “We will not allow India to become like Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, or Thailand. A curb will be placed on elements that mislead by following the agendas of anti-national forces. Any news must be factual,” panel head Dubey said. Officials in MIB and MeitY were yet to respond to HT’s request for a comment. Misinformation \n",

            "After a few slow years, M&A is heating up again. Crunchbase counted 537 M&A deals in Q4 2024. It’s the strongest quarter in seven years, up 46% year-over-year, much of it driven by an interest in AI . AI acquisitions hit a record high in Q2 2025. One of them was my company, Kraftful. Amplitude , a public company, acquired Kraftful to integrate our company’s AI-powered user feedback analysis directly into Amplitude’s platform, empowering product teams to see what their users did and said, all in one place. Kraftful turns messy, multi‐channel user feedback into prioritized product insights that will be directly tied to product usage in Amplitude. Prior to the acquisition, I ran an M&A process involving 10+ potential buyers, from public tech giants to fast-growing private companies, and I learned a ton along the way. Here are eight lessons I learned from selling my company in the middle of an acquisition boom. 1. Startups are bought, not sold You may have heard this phrase before. I had too. But here’s the nuance: It’s not that you can’t proactively sell your startup. It’s that acquisitions driven by an acquirer’s initial interest usually yield better outcomes, given your situation and the state of the market. Our process started with inbound interest from a few companies looking to buy Kraftful for strategic reasons. To ensure the best deal, I also connected directly with CEOs, CTOs, and chief product officers at 25+ companies, leading to serious conversations with more than 10 companies. Ultimately, the companies that moved fastest were those who approached us first, because they already had a strong internal motivation to buy. 2. The big decision Even if an acquisition starts with inbound interest, you still need to evaluate if it’s strategically right for your company, whether the timing makes sense, and if the opportunity cost of investing time in the process is justified even if the deal falls through. If the opportunity looks promising, limit early conversations to a defined period to quickly validate genuine interest and viability. Ideally pursue an acquisition well before you’re low on runway so you don’t lose leverage if things drag out. Market conditions matter too. When we first started our M&A process, the environment was very different than it is today. Right now, there’s an unusually high number of early-stage startups looking to get acquired, which makes securing the best possible outcome tougher. 3. The M&A process An acquisition usually takes months, though it can be squeezed into days if both parties are motivated, like the recent Windsurf/Cognition deal. Here are the main steps: Initial conversations Initial diligence Term sheet, typically a letter of intent (LOI) Deeper diligence Signing the definitive agreement (Sometimes) regulatory approval Once you sign an LOI, you’re locked into an exclusivity period—so you’ll want to explore other options and negotiate key terms before signing an LOI. The more companies you can move to LOI in parallel, the better your outcome because you can explore all your options and use them as leverage during negotiations. 4. Invest in excellent M&A lawyers I was lucky to have stellar lawyers by my side. They were experienced, fast, pragmatic, and willing to keep redlines minimal. Choose counsel with relevant M&A experience. For example, being backed by Y Combinator, Kraftful raised on YC SAFEs during multiple funding rounds. SAFE is a standard YC financing instrument, but once you enter an acquisition process, those simple agreements often become a key area of legal complexity if you don’t have experience with them. Some of the M&A lawyers I interviewed had never touched a SAFE before. I spent our calls educating them before disqualifying them. Much better to learn that upfront than to risk bad advice mid-deal. 5. Beware of snooping Yes, you’ll sign an NDA before acquisition talks. But in practice, little prevents a competitor from copying your product based on what they learn. Watch for red flags like unnecessary digging into the secret sauce of your product. My main goal in talking with multiple acquirers was to land the best deal. A side benefit was recognizing the types of questions genuine acquirers ask. That helped me spot a competitor fishing for information and to avoid disclosing trade secrets. 6. Experienced acquirers move faster The more experienced the acquirer, the faster they move. Speed is critical in M&A. I learned this the hard way. One inbound company was highly motivated to acquire us but had never made an acquisition despite being around for 15+ years. During diligence, it became obvious why: They dragged their feet and could not make a decision. Even if they eventually had been able close the deal (unlikely), their slow culture would’ve made post-acquisition life painful for any founder. 7. Don’t get emotionally attached until you close Easier said than done. After spending months in acquisition talks—often at the expense of growing your business—it’s tempting to feel obligated to sell. Resist that urge. Throughout our process, I kept reminding myself of two things: Most acquisitions fall apart before closing: Nothing is certain until the ink is dry. I was genuinely excited about the company I was still building. The best way to stay flexible? Keep shipping. Our last major product launch happened during diligence, just before closing. We pushed new features weekly right up until the end. Staying emotionally detached helped me negotiate from a position of strength. On the flip side, whenever I let myself get too attached, I felt my leverage slip. 8. Use AI to your advantage I leaned heavily on ChatGPT’s advanced reasoning models to educate myself on the M&A process and shape my strategy. I did much legal research myself with AI, then validated it with counsel. As with any negotiation, the better you understand the playing field, the better your odds. I hope this playbook helps anyone considering M&A—or simply curious about how the process really works. Yana Welinder is CEO and founder of Kraftful Inc.

            "In a monumental escalation of artificial intelligence infrastructure ambitions, OpenAI has inked a staggering $300 billion contract with Oracle Corp. to bolster its Project Stargate initiative, according to reports from The Verge . This five-year agreement, set to commence in 2027, underscores the insatiable demand for computing power in the AI sector, with OpenAI committing to purchase vast amounts of cloud infrastructure that will require an estimated 4.5 gigawatts of energy capacity. The deal builds on prior collaborations, amplifying Oracle’s role in fueling OpenAI’s expansive AI models beyond its longstanding partnership with Microsoft Azure. Project Stargate, first announced in January 2025 as a joint venture involving OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle, and investment firm MGX, aims to invest up to $500 billion in building AI data centers across the United States by 2029. As detailed in a Wikipedia entry on Stargate LLC, the project draws its name from the 1994 sci-fi film, symbolizing portals to new technological realms, and has been likened to the Manhattan Project for its scale. Initial funding commitments included $100 billion, with SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son serving as chairman, emphasizing American leadership in AI through job creation and national security enhancements. The Evolution of AI Infrastructure Partnerships Recent developments highlight how this new pact dwarfs previous arrangements. Earlier in July 2025, OpenAI secured a $30 billion annual deal with Oracle for 4.5 gigawatts of data center capacity, as reported by Bloomberg , focusing on sites in states like Texas, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. This latest $300 billion commitment, spanning five years, represents a doubling down on that investment, integrating Oracle’s cloud prowess with OpenAI’s operational expertise. Sources from The New York Times note that the funding covers more than half of OpenAI’s planned U.S. data centers, positioning Oracle as a pivotal player in diversifying OpenAI’s compute sources away from Microsoft dominance. The energy implications are profound, with 4.5 gigawatts equating to the output of several nuclear plants, raising questions about sustainability and grid strain. Industry insiders, as echoed in posts on X, express awe at the scale, with one user highlighting Oracle shares jumping 42% amid announcements of $317 billion in future contract revenue. This deal not only secures OpenAI’s path to advanced AI training but also signals a broader shift toward hyperscale infrastructure tailored for generative models. Strategic Implications for Tech Giants OpenAI’s strategy extends beyond Oracle, incorporating deals with CoreWeave and Google for custom TPUs, as outlined in a Data Center Dynamics report.

            "Doctoring in the genes Dr. Bob Lahita ran New Jersey’s top hospitals and ambulance services, operated a triage unit on the ground in NJ on 9/11, authored a library of medical volumes, cared for my late husband and I know him half a century. His new book’s ­“Destiny, the New Genetics, and Your Future.” Lahita: “Popes to presidents want to know about sickness and incapacity. ‘Epigenetics,’ a collection of light switches, means genes are fingers. Parental wiring. A pregnant mother’s diet can affect a child’s health. Cigarettes, pollution, stress, nutrition, toxins affect subsequent generations. Forget genes but changed behavior can influence the onset and course of disease. Our destiny is not fixed. “A clinician and researcher, I know health can influence future generations. It can explain autoimmunity diseases like ­depression, cancers. Grandma’s stress, what she ate or smoked can influence her grandchildren. Data is explaining issues of legitimate sources to support understanding of human behavior — and mental diseases including possibly gender dysphoria. Even autism could possibly be the result of an environment effect. “Artificial intelligence can now detect epigenetic markers on DNA that alter gene expression. Using AI to search for epigenetic markers and add or subtract them from future genomes will likely be possible.” I can’t understand all Lahita says. I only hope he doesn’t charge me when next I need him. Seeking wisdom in the stars What they are saying: Sharon Stone: “Women who lie about their age are stupid. It’s appalling. So when a 40-year-old says she’s 30, I want to go, ‘Well, honey, then you need a face-lift because you’re looking really bad.’ ” Warren Beatty: “In my 20s and 30s, I thought certain things were irresistible. Also into my 40s. And then into my 50s. Being adolescent never got boring to me.” Diane von Furstenberg: “I was once diagnosed with cancer of the palate of my mouth and at the base of my tongue. It then cleared up completely. I never smoked cigarettes so it was a surprising thing to get. Must’ve happened because I smoked so much pot.” When she was a dental assistant, Debi Mazar moved in with then-unknown Jean-Michel Basquiat: “We roomed together. I was 16. Artwork he gave me was that he painted my refrigerator inside and out with his stick figures. I loved the artwork so I hung onto the refrigerator.” Jane Fonda: “When Ted Turner and I were courting it was at a sound-and-light show in Athens, Greece, that I had my first hot flash. It was dramatic. Kind of exciting.” Pete Seeger: “Like William Randolph Hearst and Eugene O’Neill, I dropped out of Harvard. Shocked me was that after departing Harvard, I got an alumni fund-raising letter. Harvard didn’t care that I dropped out. They still wanted my money even if I hated them.” Tom Cruise’s ex Mimi Rogers: “I’m a babe so I don’t worry too much about age.

            "In a landmark move that underscores the escalating demands of artificial intelligence development, OpenAI has inked a staggering $300 billion contract with Oracle Corp. to bolster its computing infrastructure for the ambitious Project Stargate. This five-year agreement, set to commence in 2027, represents one of the largest cloud computing deals in history, according to reporting from the Wall Street Journal . The pact aims to provide OpenAI with massive computational resources, including 4.5 gigawatts of data center capacity, to fuel the next generation of AI models amid a broader industry race for supremacy. Details of the deal highlight Oracle’s role in supplying the backbone for Project Stargate, a venture initially announced earlier this year with partners like SoftBank and MGX, planning up to $500 billion in U.S.-based AI infrastructure investments. As per insights from The Verge , this collaboration builds on prior announcements, positioning Oracle as a key player in powering OpenAI’s expansive needs, which could eclipse even the most aggressive cloud contracts seen to date. Strategic Implications for AI Infrastructure Expansion The agreement comes at a time when AI companies are grappling with unprecedented energy and computing requirements. OpenAI’s push for Project Stargate, named after the sci-fi film for its portal-like ambitions in AI advancement, has been in the works since 2024, evolving from earlier discussions with Microsoft into this multifaceted partnership.

Industry analysts point out that this contract not only secures OpenAI’s position against rivals like Google and Anthropic but also signals Oracle’s resurgence in the cloud arena under CEO Safra Catz. The partnership includes provisions for building out new facilities across the U.S., with initial deployments aimed at creating thousands of jobs and enhancing national security through domestic AI capabilities, as detailed in coverage by AP News . Economic and Regulatory Ramifications Economically, the $300 billion infusion could generate ripple effects, from boosting Oracle’s backlog—already swollen by AI-driven demand—to stimulating investments in renewable energy to meet the deal’s power needs. However, challenges loom: as of mid-2025, Project Stargate had yet to secure initial funding rounds, per Wikipedia entries on the venture, raising questions about execution timelines amid fluctuating market conditions. Regulatory scrutiny is another factor, with the deal’s announcement aligning with heightened government interest in AI’s national implications. President Trump’s earlier endorsement of Stargate as a $500 billion initiative, highlighted in The Verge archives, underscores its strategic value, yet antitrust concerns could emerge given the concentration of power in few hands. Technological Underpinnings and Future Prospects At its core, the Oracle-OpenAI alliance leverages Oracle’s cloud expertise to handle the immense data processing for training advanced AI systems, potentially accelerating breakthroughs in areas like generative models and autonomous agents. Reports from TechCrunch emphasize how this deal dwarfs previous pacts, such as those with Amazon Web Services, by focusing on bespoke supercomputing clusters tailored for AI workloads. Looking ahead, insiders speculate that success here could pave the way for international expansions, including talks with Indian data firms for parts of Stargate, as noted in Angel One market updates. Yet, the venture’s viability hinges on overcoming hurdles like chip shortages and geopolitical tensions. Broader Industry Shifts and Competitive Dynamics This contract exemplifies a shift toward mega-scale collaborations in tech, where AI’s computational hunger drives unprecedented financial commitments. Oracle’s stock surged on the news, per TipRanks , reflecting investor optimism about its pivot from traditional databases to AI-centric services. For OpenAI, led by Sam Altman, the deal mitigates risks of over-reliance on Microsoft, fostering a more diversified ecosystem. As Cryptopolitan reports, it positions both firms at the forefront of an AI boom projected to transform economies, though ethical debates on energy consumption and AI safety persist. In sum, this $300 billion pact marks a pivotal chapter in AI’s evolution, blending corporate ambition with national priorities to build the digital fortresses of tomorrow. \n",

            "Anduril Industries has secured a $159 million contract from the U.S. Army to prototype a helmet-mounted mixed reality system. The award is part of the Soldier Borne Mission Command (SBMC) program, the successor to the Army’s Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS). The company says the system aims to give soldiers “superhero-like abilities,” fusing night vision, augmented reality, and artificial intelligence into one platform. The goal is faster decision-making and clearer battlefield awareness in contested environments. The Army’s earlier IVAS effort, developed with Microsoft, faced delays and technical problems after its launch in 2018. Soldiers reported headaches and nausea, leading Congress to cut funding in 2022. Anduril’s system builds on those lessons. It combines advanced optics with real-time maps, intelligence, and sensor feeds overlays. Instead of juggling radios, apps, and paper maps, soldiers will see a unified picture through helmet displays. “Military operations are inherently human endeavors, characterized by violence and continuous adaptation by all participants,” states Army Doctrinal Publication 6-0, Mission Command. “Successful execution requires Army forces to make and implement effective decisions faster than enemy forces.” Anduril says its solution reimagines the battlefield interface. “Anduril’s solution reimagines the battlefield interface giving soldiers superhero-like abilities,” the company said in its announcement . Modular hardware, open software Anduril is working with Meta, OSI, Qualcomm, and Gentex to build the hardware. The helmet-mounted display will integrate day, night, and thermal imagery with real-time intelligence. Soldiers can select modular components suited to their mission. The software backbone is Soldier Borne Mission Command-Architecture (SBMC-A). Built on Anduril’s Lattice platform, it unites the displays with edge computing devices and battlefield sensors. Anduril leads the effort with partners including Palantir, L3Harris, Persistent Systems, Sierra Nevada Corporation, and Maxar Intelligence. SBMC-A has already been tested with existing IVAS 1.2 headsets. In recent field trials, soldiers tasked drones more than three kilometers away directly from head-mounted displays. No dedicated drone operator was required. Anduril highlights that the architecture also speeds software updates. Updates that once took two days can now be pushed in 15 minutes. That allows daily changes from soldier feedback and cuts costs. Shaping the future fight The Army describes SBMC as its largest effort yet to equip every soldier with augmented perception and decision-making. The initiative integrates lessons from over 260,000 hours of soldier feedback during the IVAS program. Officials see the program as critical to overcoming one of the battlefield’s biggest challenges: fragmented information. In many operations, squad leaders must stitch together maps, radios, and apps just to track their teams and threats. That wastes precious seconds. By merging sensors, intelligence, and command tools into one system, the Army hopes to flip that disadvantage. Every soldier would see farther, know more, and act faster. Together, SBMC and SBMC-A aim to redefine soldier systems. They promise to move beyond just night vision to full perceptual augmentation. “Anduril and its partners are developing a modular component framework, enabling soldiers to select the most effective loadout for their specific mission needs,” the company said. The contract marks the Army’s latest push to modernize after years of frustration with earlier head-mounted systems. If successful, Anduril’s prototype could deliver the generational leap the Army has sought since IVAS. \n",

The discussion spoke about a range of topics, including Australia's ability to build, maintain and upgrade defence assets without international help, and also whether Nowra had lost its housing affordability advantage in the years since COVID The panel on industry featuring representatives from Transport for NSW, GM3 and BESIX Watpac discussed how projects like the Dendrobium Mine, new trains and Shellharbour Hospital might impact the region. NSW Construction Manager from BESIX Watpac, John Mattock, mentioned being very interested in Wollongong City Council Lord Mayor, Tania Brown's ambitions for a cruise ship terminal at Port Kembla . The final panel at the industry dinner was on green energy, with the potential for the region to become a powerhouse flaunted. Joining the project lead for the Illawarra Renewable Energy Zone, Peter Langdon, were Green Gravity CEO, Mark Swinnerton, and Sicona Battery Technologies CTO, Dr Andrew Minett. Discussions surrounded the need for more renewable energy around the region, which is unique due to how much energy is used by industry, and the growing need for solar power for battery technology. The second part of the showcase, a breakfast hosted by the Mercury's deputy editor, Kate McIlwain, focused on projects from BlueScope. Updates were given on the rezoning of an area, 'the size of Monaco' , the No.6 Blast Furnace relining project and Bluescope's plans for switching over to more efficient and productive use of energy. Artificial intelligence was flagged by General Manager David Scott as part of BlueScope's future in improving automation at the steelworks and boosting productivity. The event was attended by more than 230 people for the dinner session with another 200 making there way to the showcase the next morning for the breakfast session.

            "Investors have reportedly offered to arrange a new funding round of $100 million for Mercor Inc. that would value the startup at upwards of $10 billion. TechCrunch on Thursday cited sources as saying that Mercor has received multiple offers from prospective backers. The tipsters added that the company was holding discussions with those investors. Mercor Chief Executive Officer Brendan Foody (pictured, center, with co-founders Adarsh Hiremath and Surya Midha) dismissed the latter assertion in a statement. Mercor supplies OpenAI, Nvidia Corp. and other tech firms with artificial intelligence training data. The data is prepared by what the company describes as a network of more than 300,000 experts. Besides access to relevant professionals, Mercor also provides tools that AI developers can use to manage data sourcing projects. The company determines which expert to assign to what project based on multiple factors. If a customer orders a dataset that contains Python code, Mercor might recruit developers who have contributed to open-source Python applications hosted on GitHub. The company also evaluates work histories, Google Scholar citations and other parameters. The $10 billion valuation that the prospective Mercor investors reportedly floated represents a steep increase from the $2 billion at which it was valued in February. The valuation jump is presumably tied to the company’s rapid sales growth. According to TechCrunch, Mercor’s annualized recurring revenue jumped from $100 million in March to over $450 million today. The company’s annualized revenue figures reportedly describe the total amount that customers pay it for training data. Mercor disburses a significant percentage of the proceeds to the experts who prepare the data. According to its website, the company makes money by charging a flat percentage fee. Mercor’s revenue growth may be driven partly by the customers who reportedly stopped working with rival Scale AI Inc. in June. That month, the latter company sold a 49% stake to Meta Platforms Inc. for $14.3 billion. The Facebook parent also hired Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang and several other key staffers. This isn’t the only fast-growing AI data provider that competes with Scale AI. Surge AI Inc., another rival, is reportedly seeking a $1 billion funding round that could value it at $15 billion valuation. Its revenue reportedly topped $1 billion in 2024. Mercor plans to differentiate its platform from rivals partly by launching new automation features. According to a June job posting , the company is working on AI tools that can help organizations recruit workers more efficiently. TechCrunch reported that Mercor also intends to develop an “AI-powered recruiting marketplace” and reinforcement learning software. \n",

            "NEW YORK: The S&P 500 and Nasdaq notched record-high closes on Wednesday, as Oracle surged and cooler-than-expected inflation data supported expectations the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next week. Oracle soared 36% in its biggest one-day percentage gain since 1992 after the tech company pointed to a demand surge from AI firms for its cloud services. Its stock market value reached US$922 billion, leapfrogging the values of Eli Lilly, JPMorgan Chase and Walmart, and approaching Tesla's US$1.12 trillion market value. Artificial intelligence-related chip stocks also rallied, with Nvidia up 3.8%, Broadcom jumping 10% and Advanced Micro Devices climbing 2.4%. The PHLX chip index rose 2.3% to a record high. Data center power suppliers also benefited, with Constellation Energy, Vistra and GE Vernova all rising more than 6%. Apple, viewed by many investors as lagging in the race to dominate AI, declined 3.2%, sliding for a fourth straight session. A cooler-than-expected producer prices reading provided additional momentum as traders shored up their bets on interest-rate cuts this year. Recent labor market data has confirmed the US jobs market is in a slowdown. Traders fully expect the Fed to cut interest rates by at least 25 basis points at its policy meeting next week, with a 10% chance the central bank could cut by 50 basis points, CME's FedWatch tool showed. The S&P 500 has now climbed about 11% in 2025, while the Nasdaq has rallied about 13%. \"The fundamentals remain very strong in the equity markets, domestically. But we also have to acknowledge that valuations are extended at this point and serve as some natural tension to a continued upward trajectory,\" said Bill Northey, senior investment director at US Bank Wealth Management in Billings, Montana. The S&P 500 climbed 0.30% to end the session at 6,532.04 points, closing with a record high for the second straight day. The Nasdaq gained 0.03% to 21,886.06 points for its third consecutive record-high close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.48% to 45,490.92 points. Six of the 11 S&P 500 sector indexes declined, led lower by consumer discretionary, down 1.58%, followed by a 1.06% loss in consumer staples. Investors will now focus on consumer prices data due on Thursday, for insights on where U.S. inflation is headed. \"Combining the softer data (PPI figures) with the Fed's increased emphasis on the labor market side and the growing trend we've seen in downward revisions to the monthly employment data – all support the expectation for a rate cut,\" said Jordan Rizzuto, CIO at GammaRoad Capital Partners. In a setback for the White House, a federal judge on Tuesday temporarily blocked US President Donald Trump from removing Fed Governor Lisa Cook. Barclays and Deutsche Bank raised their year-end targets for the S&P 500, citing stronger corporate earnings, resilient US economic growth and optimism around artificial intelligence. Synopsys tumbled 36% in its biggest one-day decline on record after the chip design software provider missed Wall Street estimates for quarterly revenue. Rival Cadence Design Systems fell 6.4%. Declining stocks outnumbered rising ones within the S&P 500 by a 1.5-to-one ratio. The S&P 500 posted 19 new highs and 8 new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 112 new highs and 72 new lows. Volume on US exchanges was relatively heavy, with 17.2 billion shares traded, compared with an average of 16.0 billion shares over the previous 20 sessions. — Reuters \n",

A “person of interest” was in custody Wednesday evening, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said, though no charges were immediately announced. Videos posted to social media show Kirk speaking into a handheld microphone at Utah Valley University in Sorensen Center courtyard, sitting under a white tent emblazoned with the slogans, “The American Comeback” and “Prove Me Wrong.” A single shot rings out and Kirk reaches up with his hand as a large volume of blood gushes from the left side of his neck. Stunned spectators gasp and scream. Some run away. The shooting quickly drew reaction from leading political figures, including some victims of political violence. Here’s the latest: After Kirk’s killing, security measures heightened for 9/11 anniversary events in New York New York City police say the killing in Utah is prompting added security for events in the city marking the 24th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. Vice President JD Vance is set to attend tomorrow’s memorial ceremony at the World Trade Center site while President Donald Trump is scheduled to be at the night game pitting the Yankees against the Tigers. Security around the 9/11 commemorations in New York is always comprehensive, with street closures, a large police presence and the Sept. 11 memorial plaza in Lower Manhattan closed to the public. Officials didn’t detail exactly how security would be increased. Moments before the shooting Video shows Kirk had been taking questions from an audience member about mass shootings and gun violence. “Do you know how many transgender Americans have been mass shooters over the last 10 years?” an audience member asked. Kirk responded, “Too many.” The questioner followed up: “Do you know how many mass shooters there have been in America over the last 10 years?” “Counting or not counting gang violence?” Kirk asked. Then a single shot rang out. Thousands turned out for Kirk’s appearance and police were also present Jeff Long, chief of Utah Valley University Police Department, says six officers working at Kirk’s campus event and more than 3,000 people were in attendance. The police chief says his officers coordinated their operation with Kirk’s security team, and plainclothes police officers were also present. At the time he was shot, Kirk was speaking to the throng in a low area surrounded by campus buildings. Long said law enforcement tries to get the “bases covered.” But he added, “unfortunately today we didn’t, and because of that we have this tragic incident.” Students, meanwhile, told The Associated Press they saw no metal detectors or bag checks. The amount of security appeared consistent with other speaking engagements on Kirk’s national tour. Suspect released, shooter still at large: FBI director The suspect in the killing of Charlie Kirk has been released after an interrogation with law enforcement, according to FBI Director Kash Patel. The subject in custody has been released after an interrogation by law enforcement. Our investigation continues and we will continue to release information in interest of transparency https://t.co/YXsG6YpFR5 “The subject in custody has been released after an interrogation by law enforcement. Our investigation continues and we will continue to release information in interest of transparency,” Patel said in a post on X. Tammy Ibrahimpoor, CTV News producer FBI appeals to the public for information about the shooting The FBI’s Salt Lake City office has added an online form to its website where the public can report information about Kirk’s killing. The form says the FBI is “seeking information regarding the shooting at Utah Valley University that took place on September 10, 2025.” It asks the person submitting the form to include their name and contact information and then includes a section for information about the incident. Donald Trump Jr. says Kirk wasn’t a threat to anyone In a lengthy social media post, President Trump’s son says Kirk wasn’t just a friend, but was “like a little brother to me” and a “true inspiration.” Trump Jr. said Kirk “changed the direction of this nation” because “there is no question that Charlie’s work and his voice helped my father win the presidency.” He said Kirk was civil and kind, and listened and responded with respect. “The only `threat’ he ever posed was that he was incredibly effective. He was a powerful messenger of truth, and people heard that truth. That’s what made him a target.” Democrats in Congress mourn Kirk Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell of Michigan appeared visibly upset while speaking to reporters on the steps of the U.S. Capitol. She said that she cried when she found out that Kirk had died. “All of us have got to work together and deescalate the heat and the rhetoric in this country, she said. Dingell added: “And remember we’re Americans, and you can disagree in a way that doesn’t end in the horrible way today did.” Rep. Jamie Raskin expressed condolences to Kirk’s family, adding, “What a nightmare this whole thing is.” “It’s a very dark time with the political violence spiraling out of control and gun violence a threat to everybody,” Raskin continued. Utah governor says Kirk’s death carries a tragic message for the state of the country Gov. Spencer Cox said that Kirk had come to the Utah Valley University campus to represent his conservative views and debate. Targeting people for their ideas threatens the country’s “constitutional foundations,” he said. “We just need every single person in this country to think about where we are and where we want to be,” he said. “I don’t care what his politics are. I care that he was an American.” Cox said the first of the inalienable rights enshrined in the Declaration of Independence is “life, and today a life was taken. Charlie Kirk was first and foremost a husband and a dad to young children. He was also very much politically involved. And that’s why he was here on campus. Charlie believed in the power of free speech and debate to shape ideas and to persuade people.” President of the university where Kirk was killed calls his death tragic Utah Valley University President Astrid Tuminez posted on X that the school is “shocked and saddened” by Kirk’s death. She expressed her condolences to his family and said they are grieving with the many people from the school who saw the “unspeakable tragedy” unfold. “We firmly believe that UVU is a place to share ideas and to debate openly and respectfully. Any attempt to infringe on those rights has no place here,” the statement said. Kirk backers leave flowers at Turning Point headquarters The flags outside Turning Point USA’s Phoenix headquarters have been lowered to half staff. Bouquets of flowers delivered by well-wishers are piling up by the main door to one of at least three buildings that make up Turning Point’s campus. The organization’s presence has grown steadily in a quiet neighborhood at the base of South Mountain park. Former President George W. Bush says violence must be `purged from the public square’ Bush lamented the killing and said “an open exchange of opposing ideas should be sacrosanct” on a college campus, where Kirk was shot. In his statement, Bush added: “Members of other political parties are not our enemies; they are our fellow citizens.” The Republican ex-president closed the statement by asking God to bless Kirk and his family and “guide America toward civility.” Another former president, Democrat Bill Clinton, wrote on X that he was saddened and angered by the killing, adding he hoped “we all go through some serious introspection” and “redouble our efforts to engage in debate passionately, yet peacefully.” I’m saddened and angered by Charlie Kirk’s murder. And I hope we all go through some serious introspection and redouble our efforts to engage in debate passionately, yet peacefully. Hillary and I are keeping Erika, their two young children, and their family in our prayers. Kirk follower says he went to Turning Point USA’s headquarters to give large donation in person Retiree Alex Lane said news of Kirk’s killing prompted him to head to the organization’s Phoenix headquarters and hand the organization a $10,000 check. “I hope and trust that they’re going to continue with the message that he had,” Lane, 54, told The Associated Press while standing outside the headquarters. Lane said he was a follower of Kirk’s and had given to Turning Point before, but never such a large sum. “It’s a huge loss, there’s no question about it,” Lane said. “But I think the important thing for people to understand is that (Kirk’s message) is going to continue. The assassin didn’t stop it. If anything, I think it will bring more attention to his message.” Lawmakers reflect on Kirk’s influence Multiple Republicans in Congress knew Kirk personally and were devastated by his death. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida spoke on the Capitol steps, reflecting on his influence on her political journey. Luna said she was planning to go to medical school before Kirk recruited her to work as his national Hispanic outreach director. She attended events where Kirk debated students, like the one he hosted today. “That conversation needs to happen,” Luna said. “You can’t squelch that.” Kirk killed with single shot in supposed targeted attack, authorities say Utah Gov. Spencer Cox called the killing a “political assassination.” A “person of interest” was in custody Wednesday evening, Cox said, though no charges were immediately announced. “This is a dark day for our state,” Cox said. “We are actively looking for anyone and everyone who has any information related to the shooting,” he said. Utah authorities said the shooter wore dark clothing and fired from a roof on campus some distance away. RFK Jr., son and nephew of assassinated leaders, laments another loss Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appeared to invoke his family’s losses as he reacted to Kirk’s killing. “Once again, a bullet has silenced the most eloquent truth teller of an era,” Kennedy wrote on social media. He called Kirk a “relentless and courageous crusader for free speech.” Kennedy’s father, for whom he was named, was assassinated in 1968 as he sought the Democratic presidential nomination. The elder Kennedy was an outspoken critic of the Vietnam War before many elected leaders in Washington. He also had been an advocate for civil rights legislation as attorney general during his brother’s presidency and after John F. Kennedy’s assassination in 1963. Person suspected in fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk now in custody, FBI director says The person suspected of fatally shooting conservative activist Charlie Kirk on a Utah college campus Wednesday is now in custody, according to a social media post from FBI Director Kash Patel. The subject for the horrific shooting today that took the life of Charlie Kirk is now in custody. Thank you to the local and state authorities in Utah for your partnership with @fbi . We will provide updates when able. Kirk fans pay their respects at the Turning Point headquarters in Phoenix One man delivered flowers and wiped tears from his face as he left. He said he was too broken up to speak to reporters. On the sidewalk, 14-year-old Samuel Monahan embraced his parents in prayer. “This is what happens when we’re without God,” said Monahan. The teenager said he admired Kirk for being a man of God who cared about people. The country is so polarized, he said, “but it didn’t have to be that way because we all bow our heads under one flag and under one God.” Former President Obama condemns Kirk’s `despicable’ killing “This kind of despicable violence has no place in our democracy,” former President Barack Obama wrote on X. We don’t yet know what motivated the person who shot and killed Charlie Kirk, but this kind of despicable violence has no place in our democracy. Michelle and I will be praying for Charlie’s family tonight, especially his wife Erika and their two young children. He said he and former first lady Michelle Obama will pray for Kirk’s wife and two young children. Chaffetz says he’s angry about Kirk’s death “It makes me mad. I’m so mad that this happened in our backyard. It’s an embarrassment,” the Utah Republican former member of Congress told Fox News Channel. Chaffetz was at the event where Kirk was shot. “We’re better than this, but there’s somebody out there who is evil, absolute total, complete evil and they need to be taken down,” he said. Kirk’s appearance at Utah Valley University marked the kickoff of his national college tour He was calling it “The American Comeback Tour.” And he was featuring his “Prove Me Wrong Table,” where Kirk sat, as he was Wednesday, and fielded questions from students, including those who disagreed with him. He also had appearances slated for Colorado State University, the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, Virginia Tech University, Utah State University, the University of North Dakota, Montana State University, Indiana University Louisiana State University and the University of Mississippi over the next two months. The scene around campus Armed officers are walking around the neighborhood bordering the campus, knocking on doors and asking for information on the shooter. Officers have been seen looking at a photo on their phones and showing it to people to see if they recognize a person of interest. Mayor urges people to report anything suspicious Mayor David Young of the north-central Utah city of Orem says several local, state and federal law enforcement agencies are investigating and that the suspect in Kirk’s shooting remains at large. Young says police in Orem and at Utah Valley University are among many agencies involved in the investigation. Meanwhile, authorities have told anyone at Utah Valley University to ‘secure in place’ after Wednesday’s shooting. The campus was closed, and a post on the school’s emergency information page told those still on campus to call officials to be escorted out. An increase in violence against public officials Kirk’s killing follows instances of political violence in the United States in recent months, including the assassination of a Democratic Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband in June and the fatal shooting of two Israeli Embassy staffers in Washington in May. Though little is known about the shooter or the motive in this case, it can’t be ignored that polarization and normalization of violence have become threaded through U.S. politics, said Kurt Braddock, an assistant professor of public communication at American University. Braddock pointed to data from Princeton University’s Bridging Divides Initiative, which shows that threat and harassment incidents against local officials also have been gradually increasing. “We’re moving in a very dangerous direction, and I think we have been moving in this direction for quite some time,” Braddock said. Charlie Kirk is dead, Trump says Trump says the conservative activist and his close ally died Wednesday after being shot at a college event in Utah. The president posted on Truth Social that the conservative activist and his close ally died Wednesday after being shot at a college event in Utah. “No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie. He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us.” Person arrested is not a suspect, AP source says A person who was taken into custody at Utah Valley University was not the suspect, according to a person familiar with the investigation who was not authorized to speak publicly. It was not clear if authorities were still searching the campus for a suspect. Michelle L. Price Trump says Kirk ‘was a very, very good friend’ In a phone interview with the New York Post, Trump said Kirk is “not doing well” and “it looks very bad.” “He was a very, very good friend of mine and he was a tremendous person,” Trump said. Kirk invite to Dartmouth College campus was in demand: school president Dartmouth College President Sian Beilock says a bipartisan student group invited Kirk to that Ivy League campus for a Sept. 25 event. Beilock says the event “was sold out within 10 minutes.” Beilock made the comment during a media event Wednesday with other college presidents.

According to CNN, Israel immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, calling it part of an operation codenamed \"Summit of Fire\". According to Hamas, six individuals were killed in the strike, including five of its members. However, the group confirmed that its negotiating delegation survived.Among those killed were the son of Hamas\\' chief negotiator Khalil Al-Hayya and the director of his office. A Qatari security official also reportedly died in the attack, CNN reported. As per CNN, the strikes hit West Bay Lagoon, a high-end residential district in Doha where, according to Qatar\\'s foreign ministry, members of Hamas\\' political bureau had been residing. At the time of the strike, Hamas said its representatives were reviewing a US-backed ceasefire proposal. While Al-Hayya was believed to be the main target, he was not among the dead. Following the strike, Qatar\\'s Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly condemned the attack, calling it a \"cowardly\" and \"criminal assault\" that violated international laws and norms.

While the move was blasted by conservation and environmental groups, it was lauded by the oil and gas industry. “The Conservation and Landscape Health rule upended over a century of public lands management practices that strike a balance between providing the resources our nation needs with protecting the environment,” said Western Energy Alliance President Melissa Simpson. “Whereas lands leased for oil and natural gas development are still available for numerous other uses such as recreation, land that would be set aside for conservation would restrict other productive uses,” she added. The Independent Petroleum Association of America’s chief operating officer and executive vice president Dan Naatz agreed. “ Independent oil and natural gas producers have always opposed this misguided policy pushed by the Biden administration. The rule turned the long-standing policy of ‘multiple use’ of federal lands on its head and was another step toward non-use of public lands. It would have had devastating impacts for towns and communities throughout the Intermountain West and we strongly support Secretary (Doug) Burgum’s actions today.\" A statement released by the Interior Department said the 2024 Public Lands Rule made conservation (i.e., no use) an official use of public lands, putting it on the same level as BLM’s other uses of public lands. The previous administration had treated conservation as “no use,” meaning the land was to be left idle rather than authorizing legitimate uses of the land like grazing, energy development or recreation, the agency said. Additionally, the agency noted that stakeholders (including the energy industry, recreational users and agricultural producers) across the country expressed deep concern that the rule created regulatory uncertainty, reduced access to lands and undermined the long-standing multiple-use mandate of the Bureau of Land Management as established by Congress. A betrayal of public lands? But some environmental groups described the proposed recision as a betrayal of the public lands. The Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance issued this statement: “America’s wildest public lands face unprecedented threats from the Trump administration and its repeated decisions to prioritize fossil fuel development and extractive industry over clean water, wildlife habitat, and wild open spaces. This is especially the case in Utah, where Trump’s policies are having devastating consequences for the nation’s redrock wilderness,” said Steve Bloch, SUWA’s legal director. SUWA did confirm, however, that no conservation leases had been issued under the Biden administration. But the proposed scrapping of the rule, even though it had not been used, brought condemnation. “Trump’s decision to scrap this rule is nothing short of a betrayal of America’s public lands. Our laws are clear that conservation is not optional. It’s a core part of multiple use,” said Randi Spivak, public lands policy director at the Center for Biological Diversity. “For far too long, the Bureau of Land Management has tilted the scales toward drilling, mining and grazing. Gutting the Public Lands Rule will harm wildlife, clean water, and the communities that depend on healthy lands. The Trump administration’s move hands the keys of our shared heritage to extractive industries and tries to lock the rest of us out. But doing so is not lawful,” Spivak said. The Natural Resources Defense Council said the repeal signals the administration’s intent to dismantle commonsense protections and hand public lands over to unchecked industrial development. “Eliminating this rule is a dangerous step backward that puts endangered wildlife, rural communities, and clean drinking water at risk,” said Bobby McNaney, the group’s director of land conservation. “The Bureau of Land Management is supposed to think about more than just mining, timber, and oil and gas development. By moving to dump the Public Lands Rule, it is trying to jettison a critical mechanism that helps to ensure that conservation is on equal footing.”', 'pubDate': '2025-09-11 00:35:50', 'pubDateTZ': 'UTC', 'image_url': 'https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/2XIJWCDEJ5DWFO3PZM3N23XS5Y.JPG?auth=99582aed8a032d48247adf43271aa99423abcd02af76450675b0cfaf2278dae6&focal=0%2C0&height=533&width=800', 'video_url': None, 'source_id': 'deseret', 'source_name': 'Deseret', 'source_priority': 105789, 'source_url': 'https://www.deseret.com', 'source_icon': 'https://n.bytvi.com/deseret.png', 'language': 'english', 'country': ['united states of america'], 'category': ['sports'], 'sentiment': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'sentiment_stats': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_tag': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_region': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_org': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_summary': \"The U.S. Department of Interior, under Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, is proposing to rescind a 2024 rule that placed conservation on the same level as other uses of public lands, a move supported by the oil and gas industry but opposed by conservation groups.

It described the initiative as a decisive opportunity for the President Bola Ahmed Tinubu administration to leave a legacy of sustainable funding for Nigeria’s fragile healthcare system and to protect the health of Nigerian citizens. Speaking at a recent national health-financing dialogue in Abuja, Mr. Taiwo Oyedele, Chairman of the Presidential Fiscal Policy and Tax Reforms Committee, disclosed that the Federal Government is finalising a draft policy to channel excise-tax revenues from alcohol, tobacco, and sugary drinks into health financing. According to him, the policy will soon be submitted to the Minister of Health and Social Welfare. Responding to the disclosure in a statement on Monday, CAPPA referenced local and World Health Organisation (WHO) reports showing that Nigeria is reeling from grossly inadequate public health financing and grappling with the double burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), fuelled by the excessive consumption of sugar-laden beverages, salt, tobacco and alcohol by citizens. These diseases, it added, were responsible for nearly 30 per cent of all deaths in the country, making the situation a public health emergency. By initiating the draft policy, the FG has demonstrated commitment towards tackling the upsurge of NCDs in the country, CAPPA said. It urged the government to take comprehensive action, not only by earmarking SIN Taxes but also by adopting the recommendations of the WHO and CAPPA to make the taxes effective. This would involve benchmarking them on rates high enough to reduce consumption, encourage product reformulation, and ultimately ease the country’s health burden. The WHO had recently advised Nigeria and other member states to raise the prices of sugary drinks, alcohol, and tobacco by 50 percent through taxation over the next decade, as a means of curbing NCDs. The organisation expressed confidence that such measures would cut consumption of these harmful products, which contribute to illnesses such as diabetes and cancer, while also generating critical revenue for public health. The call was part of its “3 by 35 Initiative,” a global effort, which, according to the WHO, comes at a time when health systems are under immense strain from rising NCDs, shrinking development aid, and mounting public debt. NCDs, including heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, account for over 75 percent of all deaths worldwide, and, according to the WHO, a one-time 50 percent price increase on these products could prevent 50 million premature deaths over the next 50 years. ALSO READ : Dangote, NUPENG reach agreement, suspend strike Akinbode Oluwafemi, Executive Director of CAPPA, applauded the Tax Reforms Committee’s courage and vision in drafting the policy but cautioned that unless the health taxes are raised to an effective threshold, the policy will not achieve its intended goal. “We commend the government for proposing to earmark the revenues from SIN tax to public health, as long advocated by WHO, CAPPA and other pro-public health civil society organisations in Nigeria. However, we must emphasise that in the case of sugary drinks, the impact of this draft policy will only be maximised if Nigeria significantly raises SSB tax from the current N10 per litre to at least N130 per litre, adjustable to inflation. “CAPPA has consistently recommended, based on available evidence and in-depth research, that the current N10 per litre excise duty—introduced under the 2021 Finance Act—is grossly inadequate. At N10, the tax represents only about N3.33 on a N300, 50cl bottle, less than 1 percent of the retail price. Such a token measure cannot meaningfully discourage excessive consumption or generate substantial revenue,” Oluwafemi stated.', 'pubDate': '2025-09-11 00:35:00', 'pubDateTZ': 'UTC', 'image_url': 'https://tribuneonlineng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CAPPA-860x502.png', 'video_url': None, 'source_id': 'tribuneonlineng', 'source_name': 'Tribune', 'source_priority': 84500, 'source_url': 'https://tribuneonlineng.com', 'source_icon': 'https://n.bytvi.com/tribuneonlineng.png', 'language': 'english', 'country': ['nigeria'], 'category': ['top'], 'sentiment': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'sentiment_stats': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_tag': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_region': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_org': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_summary': \"CAPPA praises the Federal Government's draft policy to allocate excise tax revenues from alcohol, tobacco, and sugary drinks to health financing, seeing it as a chance to address Nigeria's public health crisis.

He championed the Lynn Public Library, directing more than $10 million in city funds toward its programs and operations. But his most memorable contributions were the ones that put books directly into children’s hands.In his first year in office, McManus launched an incentive program that encouraged children to read at least 20 books during the summer months. To celebrate their success, he invited participants to City Hall for an ice cream party, where they were recognized with citations and gifts.“The idea of the incentive program is to promote the importance of reading and reward each individual for hard work and dedication to achieving the goal of reading a total of 20 books,” McManus told The Item in 1995.Chief Librarian Theresa Hurley said such initiatives made a lasting impact. “Studies have shown that children may experience the ‘Summer Slide,’ where children lose knowledge and skills they had during the academic year, particularly for those who have less access to educational opportunities during the summer,” she explained. “It is important to keep kids active, not just physically, but mentally active during the summer months which includes reading, participation in entertaining/educational programs, and peer interaction.”Now, decades later, McManus’ vision for an educated, thriving city will be permanently remembered at the library he championed.

Déjà reconnu pour réduire le risque de démence, le régime méditerranéen protège particulièrement les personnes les plus vulnérables : celles présentant un risque génétique élevé de développer la maladie d’Alzheimer. Les groupes à haut risque en ont bénéficié davantage La maladie d’Alzheimer comporte une forte composante génétique, avec une transmission héréditaire estimée jusqu’à 80 %. Un gène, l’apolipoprotéine E (APOE), constitue le facteur de risque le plus important. Récemment publiée dans Nature Medicine , l’étude a suivi 4215 femmes et 1490 hommes pendant près de trois décennies. Elle a montré que les personnes porteuses de deux versions de la variante du gène APOE4 — qui multiplie par 12 le risque de maladie d’Alzheimer — connaissaient la plus forte réduction du risque de démence lorsqu’elles adoptaient un mode alimentaire méditerranéen. Au cours de l’étude, ceux qui suivaient un régime de type méditerranéen ont présenté globalement des taux plus faibles de démence et un déclin mental plus lent. Toutefois, l’effet protecteur s’est révélé particulièrement marqué chez les personnes porteuses de deux versions du gène APOE4. Les chercheurs ont étudié le lien entre alimentation, génétique et risque d’Alzheimer en analysant des questionnaires alimentaires, des échantillons de sang et des données génétiques, puis en surveillant les participants au fil du temps pour repérer les signes de démence. Comment le régime méditerranéen soutient la santé cérébrale Les mécanismes reliant alimentation et expression génétique dans la maladie d’Alzheimer ne sont pas encore totalement compris. Les chercheurs soupçonnent toutefois que des facteurs épigénétiques — des modifications de l’activité des gènes influencées par l’environnement, notamment l’alimentation — interviennent dans ce processus. Les auteurs de l’étude estiment qu’une consommation accrue d’aliments typiques du régime méditerranéen augmente les niveaux de graisses saines dans l’organisme, ce qui pourrait soutenir la santé du cerveau. Ce régime favorise aussi une hausse de certains composés naturels, comme la pipérine, la bétaïne et l’acide pantothénique, connus pour protéger les cellules cérébrales. Par ailleurs, il pourrait influencer des substances liées à la dégradation de la caféine, aux propriétés antioxydantes et neuroprotectrices, notamment chez les porteurs du gène APOE4. « Ces résultats suggèrent que des stratégies alimentaires, et en particulier le régime méditerranéen, pourraient contribuer à réduire le risque de déclin cognitif et retarder la démence en agissant globalement sur des voies métaboliques clés », a déclaré dans un communiqué l’auteure principale Yuxi Liu, chercheuse au Brigham and Women’s Hospital (Mass General Brigham). « Cette recommandation s’applique à tous, mais elle pourrait être encore plus cruciale pour les personnes ayant un risque génétique élevé. » Les aliments qui nourrissent le cerveau Le régime méditerranéen met l’accent sur des aliments qui soutiennent la santé neuronale, a expliqué à Epoch Times le Dr Brynna Connor, médecin de famille certifiée et spécialiste en médecine anti-âge et régénérative, non impliquée dans l’étude. Ces aliments comprennent les poissons gras, les légumes à feuilles vertes, les céréales complètes et les fruits rouges. Riches en acides gras oméga-3, les poissons gras apportent d’importants bienfaits pour le cerveau. Ces nutriments essentiels soutiennent les processus cognitifs, protègent contre les maladies neurodégénératives et aident à maintenir la santé cérébrale dans son ensemble. Des recherches ont montré un lien direct entre la consommation d’oméga-3 et un vieillissement cérébral plus lent, ainsi qu’un déclin cognitif réduit. Les personnes qui mangent plus d’aliments riches en oméga-3 présentent souvent une plus grande quantité de matière grise, région clé du cerveau liée à la mémoire, à l’apprentissage et à la prise de décision. « Quand on pense aux poissons gras, on pense souvent au saumon ; mais d’autres options existent : le maquereau, le thon rouge, les sardines, le bar rayé, le hareng, le poisson à chair blanche ou encore les anchois », a précisé le Dr Connor. Selon elle, les noix constituent une autre bonne source d’oméga-3. Des recherches montrent que les personnes qui en consomment régulièrement présentent une mémoire et des fonctions cognitives meilleures que celles qui n’en consomment pas. Les légumes à feuilles vertes du régime méditerranéen contribuent également au maintien des fonctions cérébrales. « Riches en nutriments et en antioxydants bénéfiques pour le cerveau, les légumes à feuilles vertes comme les épinards, le chou frisé ou la roquette jouent un rôle crucial dans la protection des voies neuronales », a déclaré le Dr Connor. Des études menées chez des personnes âgées de 58 à 99 ans ont montré une forte corrélation entre une consommation fréquente de légumes verts et une meilleure santé cognitive. Le cerveau des plus gros consommateurs fonctionne comme celui de personnes plus jeunes d’une dizaine d’années. « Pour maximiser les bénéfices des légumes verts, visez au moins une portion par jour, avec d’autres choix comme les feuilles de chou vert, le bok choy ou les bettes, afin de protéger contre le déclin cognitif lié à l’âge », a ajouté le Dr Connor. Emily Feivor, diététicienne au Northwell Health, également non impliquée dans l’étude, a souligné que la faible teneur en aliments transformés du régime méditerranéen aide à « prévenir l’inflammation associée aux troubles cognitifs ». Pourquoi davantage de recherches sont-elles nécessaires ? « L’une des raisons pour lesquelles nous avons voulu étudier le régime méditerranéen, c’est qu’il s’agit du seul modèle alimentaire qui a été directement associé à des bénéfices cognitifs dans le cadre d’un essai randomisé », a rappelé Mme Liu. L’équipe voulait comprendre si les antécédents génétiques modifiaient ces bénéfices. La recherche a porté sur des personnes instruites, d’ascendance européenne. Les scientifiques insistent sur la nécessité d’étudier des populations plus diverses afin de vérifier que ces résultats s’appliquent à tous. Aujourd’hui, les tests génétiques et sanguins ne sont pas encore utilisés en routine pour évaluer le risque d’Alzheimer, mais cela pourrait changer avec les nouvelles recherches. « Dans nos prochains travaux, nous espérons explorer si le ciblage de certains métabolites par l’alimentation ou d’autres interventions pourrait offrir une approche plus personnalisée pour réduire le risque de démence », a expliqué la chercheuse. Pour l’instant, les mécanismes précis reliant alimentation et expression du gène APOE dans la maladie d’Alzheimer ne sont pas complètement élucidés. Les chercheurs examinent si des facteurs alimentaires influencent l’activité des gènes et comment cela pourrait affecter le risque de maladie. Les facteurs épigénétiques sont considérés comme une piste possible. L’épigénétique fait référence à des modifications de l’activité des gènes qui n’altèrent pas la séquence de l’ADN, mais qui peuvent être façonnées par l’environnement, notamment l’alimentation. Des processus comme la méthylation de l’ADN (changements chimiques qui activent ou désactivent certains gènes) et la modification des histones (protéines qui contrôlent l’activité génétique) pourraient jouer un rôle dans la façon dont des facteurs de risque comme l’APOE contribuent au développement de la maladie d’Alzheimer.

After detailed image analysis, scientists have come to a potentially encouraging conclusion: If those speckled rocks were formed like they are on Earth, they might be evidence of past life on the dusty planet. The rocks “very well could be the clearest sign of life that we’ve ever found on Mars, which is incredibly exciting,” acting NASA administrator Sean P. Duffy said in a news conference Wednesday. The findings were published in the journal Nature on Wednesday. The rocks, or mudstones, are composed of finely packed sediment and covered in specks resembling poppy seeds and leopard spots. The colorful features, the study found, are minerals that - on Earth - have traditionally been created from microbial activity. Sign up to The Nightly's newsletters. Get the first look at the digital newspaper, curated daily stories and breaking headlines delivered to your inbox. The research team would need to investigate pieces of the rocks in person to confirm if a Martian microbe was behind the unusual patterns. That’s far easier said than done. But Joel Hurowitz, lead author of the study, called the rocks “probably the most astrobiologically exciting” samples identified by the Perseverance rover since it landed on Mars in 2021. “The sample contains what we believe to be a potential biosignature,” a feature that could have a biological origin, he said. “I don’t think we can say that about any of the other samples that we collected” on the rover’s journey. The rover has been exploring an area known as the Jezero Crater, which scientists say was once a lake bed with aspects that made it conducive to life. The rocks were found inside Neretva Vallis, an ancient river valley that shuttled water to the crater billions of years ago. “The thing I find most exciting about this sample is that it contains features large enough to be seen with the naked eye that could be examined to test for past life,” said Michael Tice, a study co-author and member of the Mars 2020 Perseverance science team searching for signs of life. “That’s surprisingly rare when you are studying evidence for ancient microscopic life.” One idea of how the rocks may have accumulated there, Associate Professor Hurowitz said, is that the river valley may have been temporarily dammed up, perhaps by a landslide. He said the ancient scene may have looked similar to the Mississippi River today, with mud settling to the bottom of turbid brown water. As sediment accumulated, he recounted, the muddy rocks seemed to have brought in iron, phosphorus and sulphur as well as organic matter. The organic matter is exciting in itself, Hurowitz said, because the carbon-based molecules are the building blocks of life. It could have come from a life form long ago, or it could have served as food for other living organisms. Or it could be tied to a nonliving source, such as a meteorite. “We don’t know where that matter came from, but we detect it in the mud,” Assoc-Prof Hurowitz said. “This is really the first compelling signal of organic matter that we’ve had since we landed in Jezero Crater.” But the colorful speckles on the rocks pose an even more alluring mystery. These features are two well-known minerals made of iron, phosphorus and sulfur. One called vivianite - also sometimes referred to as corpse crystals - forms during the decay of organic material and is blue-green. The other, called greigite, shows up as a dull brown. But when these two minerals are found together in sediments on Earth, Hurowitz said, it’s usually a result of microbial metabolisms. “Microbes will eat the organic matter and react it with the mud, and the by-product of that reaction is these minerals,” Assoc-Prof Hurowitz said. “That’s kind of why we’re as excited as we are about this.” The authors acknowledge that these minerals could have formed without microbes - with the involvement of heat, for instance. But the new study determined the Martian rocks don’t appear to have been heated. “The available evidence collected by the rover seems to point more strongly towards the possibility of microbial activity,” Assoc-Prof Hurowitz said. The involvement of microbes is plausible, said Nicolas Dauphas, a planetary scientist who was not involved in the research. But to be more certain would require direct measurements or detailed mineralogical and chemical analyses - and that would mean bringing the samples back to Earth. “These rocks are prime targets in the search for ancient life on Mars,” said Professor Dauphas, from the University of Hong Kong, in an email. “Only (a) Mars sample return can answer the billion-dollar question: ‘Was there ever life on Mars?’” But that journey between the planets is uncertain. Last year, NASA put its Mars Sample Return mission on a bare-bones budget. In January, the agency said it will entertain two potential approaches to grab the samples. One is a previously used “sky crane” technique demonstrated by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and the other would be a less clear option from the commercial sector. NASA is expected to confirm which strategy to pursue in the second half of next year. But President Donald Trump’s fiscal 2026 budget request, if approved by Congress, ends the Mars Sample Return mission - deeming it financially unsustainable. In Wednesday’s news conference, Mr Duffy said the administration is still committed to human exploration and, therefore, scientific research like this. He said the goal is to find better and faster ways to bring back the samples. “What we’re going to do is look at our budgets, we’re going to look at our timing and how do we spend money better and what technology do we have to get samples back more quickly,” Mr Duffy said. “So that’s a current analysis that’s happening right now.” There are ways to remotely learn more about how these speckled rocks were made, Assoc-Prof Hurowitz said. Scientists could try to mimic the Martian conditions in labs on Earth and re-create the processes that formed the minerals, which could help them understand if microbes were required. But the most fruitful - and perhaps the only really definitive - investigation would happen by analyzing the rock directly, the authors agreed. And if the minerals were created by microbes, the search for life on Mars could become a lot more interesting. “If microorganisms once existed on Mars, there is a possibility that their descendants could still be there,” Professor Tice said, “just living in different environments.”\", 'pubDate': '2025-09-11 00:32:50', 'pubDateTZ': 'UTC', 'image_url': 'https://images.thenightly.com.au/publication/C-19982911/957cfecabfe40388a93a610ff86e174b75a6390a-16x9-x0y296w4000h2250.jpg', 'video_url': None, 'source_id': 'thenightly_au', 'source_name': 'The Nightly', 'source_priority': 98849, 'source_url': 'https://thenightly.com.au', 'source_icon': 'https://n.bytvi.com/thenightly_au.png', 'language': 'english', 'country': ['australia'], 'category': ['technology', 'top', 'science'], 'sentiment': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'sentiment_stats': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_tag': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_region': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_org': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_summary': \"NASA's Perseverance rover has discovered rocks with speckled patterns on Mars, which scientists believe could be the clearest evidence of past life on the planet.

Spencer Cox, though no charges were immediately announced. Utah authorities said the shooter wore dark clothing and fired from a roof on campus some distance away. Kirk's death was announced on social media by Trump, who praised the 31-year-old co-founder and CEO of the youth organization Turning Point USA as “Great, and even Legendary.” Charlie Kirk, who helped build support for Trump among young people, dies after campus shooting Charlie Kirk, who rose from a teenage conservative campus activist to a top podcaster, culture warrior and ally of President Donald Trump, has been shot and killed. The shooting Wednesday occurred during one of his trademark appearances at a college in Utah. His death was announced by Trump in a post on his social media platform. The 31-year-old was a prominent conservative activist who embodied the pugnacious and populist approach to politics under Trump’s Republican Party. In 2012, Kirk launched Turning Point USA to reach out to young conservatives. That organization and its affiliates helped turn out voters to get Trump elected in 2024, focusing on those who felt shut out of politics and rarely cast a ballot. Politicians who have experienced violence directly react to Charlie Kirk shooting WASHINGTON (AP) — The fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at an event in Utah had particular resonance for public figures who have experienced political violence themselves. Kirk, who served as chief executive and cofounder of the youth organization Turning Point USA, made frequent appearances on college campuses and in other settings, engaging in political dialogue with students and others. Leaders who have survived public attacks or had family members victimized joined in bipartisan condemnation of the attack on Kirk. The Latest: Conservative activist Charlie Kirk is killed in Utah, 'person of interest' in custody Charlie Kirk, a conservative youth activist and CEO of Turning Point USA, has been fatally shot while speaking at an event at Utah Valley University. Gov. Spencer Cox says a “person of interest” is in custody, through no charges were immediately announced. Videos posted to social media show Kirk speaking into a handheld microphone while sitting under a white tent emblazoned with the slogans, “The American Comeback” and “Prove Me Wrong.” A single shot rings out and Kirk reaches for his neck. A large volume of blood gushes from the left side of his neck. The shooting has quickly drawn reaction from leading political figures, including some victims of political violence. 3 teens wounded in shooting at suburban Denver high school, including suspected shooter DENVER (AP) — Authorities say three teens were wounded Wednesday after one of them opened fire with a handgun at a high school in the foothills of suburban Denver. It is not clear what led up to the shooting at Evergreen High School or how the suspected shooter, believed to be a student at the school, was shot. However, a spokesperson for the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office said none of the law enforcement officers who responded to the shooting fired any shots.

South Korea’s Foreign Ministry made the announcement but gave no further details. Airport officials at Atlanta earlier said the return flight with the workers on board planned for Wednesday had been canceled. A total of 475 workers, more than 300 of them South Koreans, were rounded up in the Sept. 4 raid at the battery factory under construction at Hyundai’s sprawling auto plant.

Previous charges, delayed mental health evaluation were missed opportunities in Charlotte stabbing After Decarlos Brown Jr. was arrested for the fatal stabbing of a Ukrainian refugee aboard a North Carolina commuter train, he was quickly sent to a state mental hospital for an evaluation. That's a sharp contrast from a January arrest, where it took more than six months for a court to order a mental evaluation after Brown told officers that he had been given a human-made substance that controlled him. The January arrest was just one of the missed opportunities in Brown’s criminal history, according to experts. He had cycled through the criminal justice system for more than a decade. He now faces federal and state charges in the Aug. 22 killing of 23-year-old Iryna Zarutska, NATO scrambles jets to shoot down Russian drones in Poland, raising fears of war spillover WOHYN, Poland (AP) — Multiple Russian drones crossed into Poland in what European officials described as a deliberate provocation, causing NATO to send fighter jets to shoot them down. A NATO spokesman said it was the first time the alliance confronted a potential threat in its airspace. The incursion happened late Tuesday and into the early hours of Wednesday during a wave of strikes by the Kremlin on Ukraine. The NATO response swiftly raised fears that the war could spill over — a fear that has been growing in Europe as Russia steps up its attacks and peace efforts go nowhere. Israeli airstrikes on Yemen kill at least 35, Houthi officials say DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Yemen's Houthi rebels say Israeli airstrikes targeting the rebels in Yeman have killed at least 35 people and wounded over 130 others. Most of those killed in the strikes Wednesday were in Sanaa, the capital, where a military headquarters and a fuel station were among the sites hit, the health ministry said. Israel’s military carried out the strikes just days after Houthi rebels launched a drone attack that struck an Israeli airport. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, meanwhile, plans to seek sanctions and a partial trade suspension against Israel over the war in the Gaza Strip. The move adds to Israel’s already unprecedented global isolation as it grapples with the fallout from its strike targeting Hamas leaders in U.S.-allied Qatar on Tuesday. Over 40% of arrests in Trump's DC law enforcement surge relate to immigration, AP analysis finds WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has portrayed his federal law enforcement surge in Washington as a crime-fighting effort. However, data analyzed by The Associated Press shows that over 40% of the arrests during the operation were immigration-related. This highlights the administration’s continued focus on its hardline immigration agenda. The operation led to more than 2,300 arrests, including homicide suspects and gang members. More than 940 were immigration-related. The prominence of immigration arrests has fueled criticism that the true purpose was to expand deportations. Critics argue the effort appears more like a model for federal intervention in cities led by Democratic mayors. The administration argues that deportations are inseparable from crime reduction.\", 'pubDate': '2025-09-11 00:32:35', 'pubDateTZ': 'UTC', 'image_url': 'https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/union-bulletin.com/content/tncms/custom/image/742560ca-072e-11eb-8f70-07c5f8794a75.jpg?resize=600%2C403', 'video_url': None, 'source_id': 'union_bulletin', 'source_name': 'Union-bulletin', 'source_priority': 54849, 'source_url': 'https://www.union-bulletin.com', 'source_icon': 'https://n.bytvi.com/union_bulletin.png', 'language': 'english', 'country': ['united states of america'], 'category': ['crime', 'top'], 'sentiment': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'sentiment_stats': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_tag': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_region': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_org': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_summary': \"Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist and CEO of Turning Point USA, was fatally shot at a Utah college event, which Utah Governor Spencer Cox described as a 'political assassination.'

Spencer Cox, though no charges were immediately announced. Utah authorities said the shooter wore dark clothing and fired from a roof on campus some distance away. Kirk's death was announced on social media by Trump, who praised the 31-year-old co-founder and CEO of the youth organization Turning Point USA as “Great, and even Legendary.” Charlie Kirk, who helped build support for Trump among young people, dies after campus shooting Charlie Kirk, who rose from a teenage conservative campus activist to a top podcaster, culture warrior and ally of President Donald Trump, has been shot and killed. The shooting Wednesday occurred during one of his trademark appearances at a college in Utah. His death was announced by Trump in a post on his social media platform. The 31-year-old was a prominent conservative activist who embodied the pugnacious and populist approach to politics under Trump’s Republican Party. In 2012, Kirk launched Turning Point USA to reach out to young conservatives. That organization and its affiliates helped turn out voters to get Trump elected in 2024, focusing on those who felt shut out of politics and rarely cast a ballot. Politicians who have experienced violence directly react to Charlie Kirk shooting WASHINGTON (AP) — The fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at an event in Utah had particular resonance for public figures who have experienced political violence themselves. Kirk, who served as chief executive and cofounder of the youth organization Turning Point USA, made frequent appearances on college campuses and in other settings, engaging in political dialogue with students and others. Leaders who have survived public attacks or had family members victimized joined in bipartisan condemnation of the attack on Kirk. The Latest: Conservative activist Charlie Kirk is killed in Utah, 'person of interest' in custody Charlie Kirk, a conservative youth activist and CEO of Turning Point USA, has been fatally shot while speaking at an event at Utah Valley University. Gov. Spencer Cox says a “person of interest” is in custody, through no charges were immediately announced. Videos posted to social media show Kirk speaking into a handheld microphone while sitting under a white tent emblazoned with the slogans, “The American Comeback” and “Prove Me Wrong.” A single shot rings out and Kirk reaches for his neck. A large volume of blood gushes from the left side of his neck. The shooting has quickly drawn reaction from leading political figures, including some victims of political violence. 3 teens wounded in shooting at suburban Denver high school, including suspected shooter DENVER (AP) — Authorities say three teens were wounded Wednesday after one of them opened fire with a handgun at a high school in the foothills of suburban Denver. It is not clear what led up to the shooting at Evergreen High School or how the suspected shooter, believed to be a student at the school, was shot. However, a spokesperson for the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office said none of the law enforcement officers who responded to the shooting fired any shots.

Hoy en día, en EE. UU., millones de mujeres carecen de acceso a atención de maternidad de calidad durante y después del embarazo, lo que aumenta el riesgo de complicaciones tanto para la madre como para el bebé. Un estudio reciente de March of Dimes/Harris Poll reveló que, si bien la mayoría de los estadounidenses están familiarizados con proveedores como obstetras, ginecólogos y parteras, casi la mitad nunca ha oído hablar de una doula. Las doulas son profesionales capacitados que mejoran la atención clínica que reciben las pacientes embarazadas al brindar apoyo físico, emocional y educativo durante todo el proceso del embarazo. Los estudios demuestran que las doulas pueden reducir las complicaciones, disminuir el estrés e incluso aumentar las tasas de lactancia materna, todo lo cual contribuye a mejorar los resultados de salud. \"Nos enorgullece continuar esta colaboración con CVS Health para que más familias puedan acceder a la atención y el apoyo que merecen\", dijo Cindy Rahman , presidenta y directora ejecutiva de March of Dimes. \"Toda persona que da a luz debe sentirse vista, escuchada y apoyada a lo largo de su embarazo, y eso es exactamente lo que proporcionan las doulas. Su presencia ayuda a crear una experiencia de embarazo más respetuosa y positiva y conduce a mejores resultados para las madres y los bebés \". A través de esta colaboración de $ 4 millones y cinco años, las dos organizaciones están trabajando para elevar el papel de las doulas, diversificar la fuerza laboral y equipar a las familias y los proveedores de atención médica con recursos confiables que demuestren el papel que desempeñan las doulas en la mejora de los resultados para las madres y los bebés. El Proyecto de Acceso Equitativo a la Atención de la Doula involucra a dos cohortes de equipos basados en la comunidad, cada uno de los cuales participa en una colaboración gradual de 30 meses para expandir el acceso a la atención de la doula basada en la comunidad. Estos equipos, cada uno dirigido por organizaciones comunitarias y un hospital de atención de maternidad colaborador, forman parte de la Comunidad de Aprendizaje Activo de la Doula de March of Dimes. La segunda cohorte tiene como objetivo aumentar el acceso a la atención de doulas en cuatro comunidades locales de todo el país, que incluyen: East Orange, NJ – La Iniciativa de Equidad en la Salud Perinatal es una organización destinada a eliminar las desigualdades en la salud materna e infantil de las personas negras a través de la promoción, la educación, la participación de la comunidad, la investigación, la colaboración y el apoyo clínico.

Colaborarán con el Hospital Universitario de Loma Linda para proporcionar recursos de doula a las personas que dan a luz y a sus familias. Buffalo, NY – Calming Nature Doula Service & Center es una organización que ofrece medidas de confort y control del dolor durante el parto, al tiempo que ofrece educación integral, recursos y referencias durante todo el embarazo y el período posparto.

Trabajarán junto con el Centro Médico del Condado de Ventura para llevar este nuevo programa a sus comunidades locales de partos. A través de esta iniciativa, los sitios reciben educación profesional y capacitación de doulas, recursos de educación para el consumidor, subvenciones comunitarias para fortalecer la infraestructura local, asistencia técnica y apoyo con marketing y evaluación. Juntos, estos recursos ayudan a cada sitio a avanzar y mantener el cuidado equitativo de las doulas en sus comunidades.

You are tempted yet again by combo offers and attractive products at affordable rates as you move to check out. The result: You top up your cart with stuff that was not even on your mind when you had logged in. If brands can be woven into film scripts, then why can’t they be whisked into the quick commerce marketplaces? Impulse is the name of the game, after all. This subtle form of marketing or advertising goes beyond the usual route of sponsored ads, banners and videos that are listed on these apps. D2C brands and legacy companies rushed in when they spotted the opportunity in quick commerce, going slow on conventional digital media channels like Google and Meta. Quick commerce platforms like Instamart, Blinkit and Zepto responded immediately, thrashing out a suite of advertising packages ranging from INR 2-9 lakh for three months to increase visibility for the advertisers, according to media reports. The strategy is to let a brand onboard various SKUs on a quick commerce platform under a package. The payment is adjusted with the advertisements run for a fixed tenure. Industry stakeholders believe these apps, known for their fast delivery format, have turned into hotspots for targeted advertising, capitalising on a massive captive audience primed for purchases. This growing trend has in fact positioned quick commerce as a formidable competitor to traditional digital advertising giants like Meta (Facebook and Instagram) and Google, where escalating cost-per-click (CPC) rates are prompting brands to seek more efficient alternatives. The number of people scrolling through quick commerce platforms for their daily supplies of groceries, snacks, and essentials is expected to reach 65 Mn by 2030. For D2C brands and advertisers, this throws up a huge opportunity to boost precision marketing. The brands follow a natural course along the quick commerce turf to target the consumer segments where clicks and purchases are more likely compared to that in generic digital platforms. “I think Amazon showed the way when it comes to marketing on ecommerce platforms and they now have a robust advertising business in India. Quick commerce platforms followed naturally. Here, brands can harness first-party data in a closed-loop system to deliver more relevant options, averting a broader coverage in digital advertising,” said GV Krishnamurthy, founder of digital marketing firm AiNxtGen. “While general digital ads might annoy or miss the mark, advertising on quick commerce platforms thrive by focussing on high-intent shoppers in retail environments, achieving incremental ROI over traditional methods.” The INR 1.4-1.6 Lakh Cr advertising market is surging at 10-15% a year, with digital advertising making up 50–60% of this kitty. This share is likely to reach INR 1.5-1.7 Lakh Cr by 2029 , with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands emerging as key drivers. The advent of quick commerce has, in fact, triggered a change in consumer mindset over the past few years. And, D2C brands have zoomed in on the business by allocating 60-70% of their total marketing budget. “Unlike traditional ecommerce, where discovery can be passive, quick commerce consumers are in a buying mindset and they want it now. That makes them a fertile ground for brand experiments,” Mira Jhala, whose Frogo enables quick commerce for brands, said. She noted that these platforms are aggressively promoting their ad solutions, often subsidising trials to encourage brands to dive in. For India’s D2C space that’s likely to scale $300 Bn in value by 2030, this has sparked a rush to campaign on Zepto, Instamart, and Blinkit, especially as the festive season unfolds. Advertising on quick commerce platforms is far more performance-driven than traditional media, according to Prateek Rastogi, who cofounded healthy atta and rice brand Better Nutrition. Unlike TV or print, where impact is measured in reach and impressions, quick commerce ads convert directly into sales at the point-of-intent. What’s driving high-impulse-driven brands from FMCG, beauty and personal care, wellness and home décor park 60-70% of their marketing budget in quick commerce channels? “For FMCG staples and daily-use products, the cost per acquisition is often lower than generic digital channels because the consumer is in a ‘buying mindset’. Every rupee spent on in-app visibility, banner placements, sponsored listings, or sampling, translates to measurable sales impact,” Rastogi said. Besides targeted reach, cost-efficiency and better returns on advertising spends (ROAS) figure high on a brand’s priority list while looking to market products on quick commerce platforms. “While the absolute ad rates can be higher than Facebook or Google, the ROAS is significantly stronger in quick commerce because of instant cart conversions.” Advertising on quick commerce has seen a 3-8% conversions for D2C brands, whereas Amazon and Flipkart, where the brands invest the rest of their ad budget, deliver a 5-8% return on ad spend. For Google and Meta, it was reported at mere 1.5-3%, according to Datum Intelligence. Industry sources said that the ROAS on quick commerce platforms was 2-3 times that of Meta, Google. As brands tend to benefit more, quick commerce platforms have started upping the ante to squeeze out the maximum from the D2C brands. The founders dubbed this as an imminent challenge. “They do offer cheaper alternatives to conventional digital advertising tools. But, the rates are also increasing from the last two years when the user base multiplied. This especially holds true for the festive season when the ad rates jump at least 40-50% and soon may become unaffordable to small and new D2C brands,” alerted the founder of a Bengaluru-based athleisure brand which has its products listed on Instamart and Zepto. There’s a flip side, too. The boom in quick commerce blitz comes with a set of riders. “Mere listing on quick commerce platforms isn’t enough, especially when your top SKUs too are listed there. You can’t really be assured of better returns, even as the platforms convince us to spend money on advertisements to expect better ROAS and eventually sales conversions,” he added. According to Jhala, the performance of any brand marketing depends also on the life cycle of the product. “In the initial burst, ROAS is better than Meta or Google. We have seen campaigns on quick commerce delivering 1.5–2 times higher ROAS for the first few weeks. But, the caveat is that it normalises quickly. Once the ‘newness’ fades and competition for keywords within the app rises, it’s no longer cheaper. The sustainable ROAS still depends on the product-platform fit.” The quick commerce boom in India is on course to create a $30-40 Bn opportunity in the next three to five years. And, as the turf simmers, a three-way race to control the nearly-$7 Bn quick economy turns frenetic. The Qcom Big Three – Eternal-run Blinkit, Swiggy’s Instamart and Zepto – have seen their ad revenues zoom in recent years, driven by high-margin sponsored listings, targeted promotions, and brand partnerships. The result is a sizzling 280% surge in sales over the last two years with a topline of $1 Bn in FY24 alone. The growing advertisement ecosystem will cushion the trio against high cash burns on operational expenses. Ad revenues started from modest bases in the early years but have exploded as the platforms scaled their user base and ad tools. The annual recurring revenue (ARR) from ads across is reportedly estimated at INR 3,000–3,500 Cr for the three platforms put together. Zepto CEO Aadit Palicha had earlier said that its advertisement vertical’s ARR surged five-fold over the past year to INR 1,670 Cr ($200 Mn). Blinkit, which has a 45% share of the quick commerce pie, surpassed INR 400 Cr ad revenue in FY24 and reportedly reached INR 1,000 Cr last year. Although Instamart keeps its breakdowns less detailed, it told the shareholders in Q4 FY25 earnings call that the contribution margin has improved significantly. Like Zepto, Instamart and Blinkit, the D2C brands too are eyeing the wallet share of urban, time-pressed households looking for speed and convenience. This user segment covers millions in count, from young professionals who value instant delivery over traditional grocery shopping to health-conscious consumers in metros and Tier-I cities who want to try new, premium, or functional food products, and impulse buyers who make last-minute decisions, often adding trending or promoted products to their basket. The challenge, Rastogi said, remains in garnering visibility in an increasingly crowded marketplace. With thousands of SKUs fighting for limited screen space, smaller brands are at risk of being overshadowed by established FMCG giants with deeper ad budgets, he added. High dependence on platform algorithms is another challenge for the D2C brands because the discovery of a product often depends on search ranking and sponsored visibility. Moreover, quick commerce offers very little space for storytelling, unlike social media. The D2C brands need to create the narrative so smart that only a thumbnail and a few lines do the job. “I think the next phase of quick commerce advertising won’t be about cheap reach but about precise targeting. Whoever cracks the creative and presents a contextual relevance in a 10-second decision window will have an upper hand,” Jhala said. This means D2C brands must innovate with hyper-personalised ads – perhaps AI-driven recommendations based on past orders – to stand out. Smaller brands are battling growing pressure on their margins from high ad rates, yet, quick commerce unveils a compelling edge over traditional digital routes in the run-up to the festive days. It blends immediacy with precision to drive sales, converting speed into lasting loyalty.', 'pubDate': '2025-09-11 00:30:45', 'pubDateTZ': 'UTC', 'image_url': 'https://inc42.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=75/https://asset.inc42.com/2025/09/Zepto-ftr.jpg', 'video_url': None, 'source_id': 'inc42', 'source_name': 'Inc42', 'source_priority': 33695, 'source_url': 'https://inc42.com', 'source_icon': 'https://n.bytvi.com/inc42.png', 'language': 'english', 'country': ['india'], 'category': ['top', 'business'], 'sentiment': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'sentiment_stats': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_tag': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_region': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_org': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_summary': 'Blinkit, Zepto, and Instamart have become popular direct-to-consumer (D2C) advertising platforms during the festive season, offering higher return on ad spend (ROAS) and sales conversions compared to traditional digital channels.

Announcing a major step, CM Sai declared that the budget of the Authority has been increased from Rs 50 crore to Rs 75 crore for the better development of Scheduled Tribe communities residing in the Central Region, said the press release.

CM said that the Chhattisgarh government has taken a strong step towards inclusive development by forming the Bastar, Surguja and Central Region Tribal Development Authorities, along with the Scheduled Caste Development Authority and the Chhattisgarh State Rural and Other Backwards Classes Development Authority. He said that the primary aim of these bodies is to accelerate development works in tribal areas, ensure transparency, and deliver public services to every village and every family.

Pointing out lapses of the previous government, Sai said that lack of accountability and transparency had marred the functioning of these authorities. Many schemes failed to reach the ground due to poor monitoring. To change this situation, the present government has restructured the authorities. Membership has been broadened to include Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha MPs from the region, district panchayat chairpersons and other important public representatives. Additionally, two social workers and experts working in the field of tribal development have been nominated as members so that their experience and expertise can benefit development planning. Chief Minister further said that special focus is being given to education, healthcare and livelihood schemes for tribal communities. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Dharti Aba Tribal Village Utkarsh Abhiyan and PM Janman Yojana have opened up new avenues of development in tribal areas of Chhattisgarh. These initiatives are rapidly strengthening infrastructure such as housing, roads, electricity, drinking water and digital connectivity. He added that women's empowerment in the Central Region was a key priority. Self-Help Groups are being further strengthened with skill training, credit facilities and market linkages, enabling women to become self-reliant. For the youth of the region, technical and vocational training will be provided to prepare them for both employment and self-employment opportunities. Apart from this, Deputy Chief Minister Vijay Sharma said that Chhattisgarh's tribal culture is rich and must be preserved. He emphasised that the Authority will play a key role in ensuring nutrition, health and education for children of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs). He suggested setting up de-addiction centres to inspire tribal communities to give up alcohol, promoting early education and sports, and ensuring permanent pump connections for irrigation in the farms of PVTG farmers. Deputy Chief Minister Arun Sao remarked that the Chief Minister himself, as Chairman of the Central Region Tribal Development Authority, had come to Korba along with the entire government to hold this meeting. Notably, such a meeting was last held on November 30, 2019. Holding it in a Scheduled Area demonstrates the CM's commitment. CM Sai also announced several major initiatives to nurture the talents of tribal children and youth. He sanctioned Rs 10 crore each for the construction and operation of boys' and girls' sports complexes in Korba. Similarly, Rs 10 crore each was sanctioned for two more sports complexes dedicated to PVTG players. He also announced Rs 5 crore for the establishment of a residential school for PVTG students. To streamline traffic movement in Korba city, Chief Minister Sai announced Rs 9 crore for the construction of the Sunalia Bridge. He instructed Forest Department officials to expedite work on the Buka-Satrenga tourism project and directed them to submit a report within two months. On irrigation, CM Sai informed that Rs 2,800 crore has been sanctioned to complete 115 pending irrigation projects that had been left incomplete prior to 2015. Once completed, these projects will provide irrigation facilities to about 76,000 hectares of land.

Renewed, refurbished, pre-owned, these are smartphones that aren’t new (but they also aren’t the traditional as in ‘second hand’ or ‘used’ phones), but with an assurance that anything that needed to be has been fixed afresh, tend to deliver a lot more value and that climb up the aspirational ladder for many buyers. India’s premium renewed smartphone platform ControlZ has launched its first experience store in Gurugram, in a marked step away from the online-first and e-commerce primed approach that renewed smartphones mostly leaned on. Circling back to the fresh fixes that I touched upon earlier, ControlZ confirms every smartphone they sell undergoes more than 311 stringent quality checks and OEM-grade replacements for displays, cameras, and components. A lot of this is difficult to showcase in an online store, and the physical store should help overcome those challenges for the buyer and the seller. I asked Yug Bhatia, Founder and CEO of ControlZ, why now and how it makes things easier for consumers, and he insists this is the right time to bring that experience offline. “Consumers today care about both value and sustainability, but they also want trust. Our new store makes it easy: people can walk in, see and feel the quality for themselves, and leave with a device that’s like new—100% battery health, 18 months warranty, and zero compromise. It’s about giving people the confidence to choose renewed without a second thought,” he says. The other point of discussion revolved around consumer preferences, and how that underlines the renewed smartphone market outlook. Bhatia insists India’s renewed smartphone market is just beginning to take shape. “We believe it’s going to grow rapidly in the year ahead. Consumers are moving away from second-hand bargains and toward renewed devices that deliver quality, reliability, and peace of mind. That shift is setting new standards for the entire industry,” he says. For Bhatia, ControlZ is never about following this change, but leading it by redefining what renewed means for buyers in India. Competition in this space is increasing, and it’ll be interesting to see in a few months time, how this store has worked out for ControlZ in terms of traction. KEYNOTE MOMENTS As it is every year, Apple’s hardware keynote in 2025 too was extensive. A lot to unpack, which I did on Hindustan Times in the hours after. There’s still some unpacking to do in our weekly conversation. I’ve been speaking with analysts about their take on the announcements Apple made, as they try to make sense of it all. Are you ready? Must start with the iPhone Air, the most exciting new product announced. This is 5.6mm thick (the thinnest iPhone ever), with a 6.5-inch ProMotion display and the same A19 Pro chip that also powers the iPhone 17 Pro phones. It is a sign of the times, as Apple has to compete with the likes of Samsung’s Galaxy 25 Edge, which is 5.8mm thick. What you must ask are a series of questions. Is the iPhone Air a precursor to a foldable iPhone that’s expected next year? Is the iPhone Air a first look at the future of iPhones and not just as a separate ‘Air’ line? Is the Fusion Camera indeed a viable alternative to the versatility of a three-camera system that flagship phones have? “The iPhone 17 Air delivers notable design innovation, likely driving upgrades from loyalists of older models, including iPhone 12 through 15, while the iPhone 17 Pro lineup—with its durable, performance-focused design, enhanced battery, and advanced camera capabilities—will appeal to power users and digital natives alike. The emphasis on improved durability, including drop and scratch resistance, aligns with the growing consumer demand for longer-lasting devices,” summarises Prabhu Ram, Vice President - Industry Research Group, at CyberMedia Research (CMR). Changes on the iPhone 17 Pro line begin with the design, including a new unibody architecture, the switch to a proprietary aluminium material, the use of a Ceramic Shield instead of glass at the back to make it more scratch resistant, and of course, the brightest colour we’ve ever seen on a Pro series iPhone till now. Cosmic Orange, as it is called, will likely be the best-seller for Apple at least in initial months, because it is a step away from the traditionally serious, darker colour shades that the iPhone Pro line has always delivered. That continues to the cameras, including longer optical zoom and a larger primary sensor. The standard iPhone 17 gets a larger 6.3-inch screen size (instead of 6.1-inch) while adding an adaptive refresh rate ProMotion tech and new camera hardware including versatile selfie orientation. This runs the A19 chip, a 3-nanometer architecture chip, with a promise of better battery stamina, up to 20% faster than an iPhone 16, and a faster neural engine for artificial intelligence (AI) processing. Prices of the iPhone 17 start ₹ 82,900 with 256GB being the minimum storage spec. The iPhone 16 prices at launch, ₹ 79,900 onwards. “On the pricing front Apple has this time retained the price points except in few indicating they are expecting a flattish growth globally. Despite rupee weakening against dollar by around 5% in 2025 over 2024 they haven't made major price jumps in India,” notes Faisal Kawoosa, Chief Analyst and co-founder of Techarc. Wearables have really stepped up in terms of capabilities. The third generation AirPods Pro true wireless earbuds, features a custom advanced computational audio and custom audio drivers. Apple says the noise cancellation is optimised to be four times more effective than a previous generation, and that transparency mode is now marked by more human-like ambient voices filtering through to the ear. In our quick experience after the keynote, they aren’t wrong with their claims, with both functionalities significantly better than an earlier generation. The Apple Watch 11 gets improved cellular coverage underlined by improved hardware, heart health tracking including hypertension detection, and a up to 24 hours battery life. Alongside, the Apple Watch SE, the entry point to Apple’s Watch portfolio, gets new functionality such as sleep apnea and sleep score data, as well as 18-hour battery life with addition of fast charging. Our extensive coverage of the keynote... PASSAGE OF TIME Finally, Instagram for iPad. A 15-year wait (another thing the world’s got before GTA VI) leads us to an app that isn’t simply a stretched version of the iPhone app, so much so that this specific tablet interface will soon find space in the Instagram app for Android tablets too. “When designing Instagram for iPad, we wanted to take advantage of the bigger screen to give people more features with fewer taps, while keeping it simple,” the official statement says. Do try this out, for the iPad is often called the ultimate ‘media consumption device’ and Instagram Reels are prime content consumption in this era, and I’d love to hear your thoughts. VISION In a column recently (we didn’t get a chance to talk about this), write about the warning signs that India's telecom market is teetering on the edge of becoming a duopoly dominated by Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel, as Vodafone Idea (Vi) struggles to survive. There is an urgent need to preserve Vodafone Idea (Vi) as a significant telecom player in India. Losing Vi would erode competition—hurt price affordability, service quality, and innovation for billions of mobile users. We have seen it at multiple points in time in the past year — monthly telecom bills and recharge prices have gone up, popular affordable plans have been removed by Airtel and Jio, whilst no discernible real-world network quality improvements (do tell me if your calls no longer drop or you have full network coverage in your apartment elevator or office basement parking). I make the argument that supporting Vi isn't about corporate protectionism but a consumer welfare imperative, in the sense that diminished consumer choice, higher prices, and slowed technological advancement may be the result of a duopoly. There is a need for a clear policy intervention, if at all it is possible—like easing spectrum payment terms, restructuring debt, or other support—to help Vi stabilise and potentially regain competitiveness. Moreover, absence of incentives for new players to enter the market poses a thoughtful question — if we can’t nurture the next ‘Jio,’ alongside the current Jio, how will India stay competitive with upcoming technologies like 6G? KNOW Google will not have to sell its Chrome browser business, to address the search monopoly issue, the judge in the antitrust case has ruled. That should, for starters, put an end to all sorts of naivety where certain AI bros thought they could buy out Chrome from Google, two institutions in their own right. The judge has ruled that Google can continue to pay partners for preloading or placement of its Search or AI products, but the tech giants must share some search information with rivals and bar it from putting together any exclusive deals to distribute its Search or AI assistant products in ways that might cut off distribution for rivals. Google does contend that this guideline to share some data with rivals will impact user data privacy, and that they are looking closely at this. Big picture — this may well be the biggest signal that regulators and courts may not be as willing to break up tech giants, as many expected. OpenAI is adding a layer of parental controls to ChatGPT, which would give parents the option to link their personal ChatGPT account with the accounts of their teenage children.

Their 'Bottles for Change' initiative promotes recycling through a mobile app, collecting over 19,300 tonnes of plastic.\", 'content': \"New Delhi: According to Bisleri, India consumes 13 million tonnes of plastic every year, out of which 60% is recycled. The remaining 40% of plastic mostly contains non-recyclable items like wrappers, plastic bags, milk pouches and multilayer chips packets. To reduce the amount of plastic that ends up in landfills and water bodies, and at the same time promote sustainability, packaged water company Bisleri International under its sustainability initiative has introduced a program “Bottles for Change” initiative, which includes a mobile app to connect citizens, plastic collection agents, and recyclers to promote plastic recycling in India. Under the initiative, it collected and recycled over 19,300 tonnes of plastics, K. Ganesh, director - sustainability & corporate affairs at Bisleri International, said at the Mint Sustainability Summit 2025. “The plastic once used should be disposed and sent for recycling,” said Ganesh, pointing to the fact that this doesn't happen because people mostly litter plastic after consumption, which then goes to the landfill or oceans. Promoting circular economy “Our plastic waste management program educates and empowers citizens to practise source segregation, responsible disposal of post-consumer plastic, and to ensure all used plastic is sent for recycling to promote a circular economy, thus eliminating plastics from landfills and reaching our oceans,” Ganesh said. The company also has an app for the initiative, through which “we collect used plastics from registered stakeholders and channel them to recycling facilities, where bottles are transformed into new products and even reborn as bottles again. Multilayer plastics are repurposed into durable plastic sheets, ensuring every piece finds a second life”, said Ganesh. According to Ganesh, all PET (polyethylene terephthalate) bottles being used by Bisleri or other beverage companies can be recycled and converted into fibre yarn, which can be used to make fabric and dress materials. PET bottles can also be recycled to manufacture rPET (recycled PET), which is used to make bottles for food grade packaging applications, by causing less strain on natural resources. The government regulations for extended producer responsibility (EPR) require producers, importers, and brand owners to manage the post-consumer waste of their products. In India, this is mandated under rules like the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016, and involves mandatory registration, submitting EPR action plans, achieving annual recycling targets, and reporting on their efforts. The goal is to promote a circular economy, reduce waste, and ensure environmentally responsible disposal of products like plastic packaging, e-waste, and batteries. Bisleri also collected bottle caps and made benches of them. “The benches are made with 60 kgs of only our caps. We haven't used any pigments or any colour. Through this we are collecting all our caps, which has been used in our manufacturing facilities,” Ganesh added.\", 'pubDate': '2025-09-11 00:30:02', 'pubDateTZ': 'UTC', 'image_url': 'https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2025/09/08/1600x900/logo/Bisleri_1757347157626_1757347162430.JPG', 'video_url': None, 'source_id': 'livemint', 'source_name': 'Mint', 'source_priority': 7134, 'source_url': 'https://www.livemint.com', 'source_icon': 'https://n.bytvi.com/livemint.png', 'language': 'english', 'country': ['india'], 'category': ['business'], 'sentiment': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'sentiment_stats': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_tag': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_region': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_org': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_summary': \"Bisleri reports that India consumes 13 million tonnes of plastic annually, with only 60% being recycled.

Why? Because search engines can hand us endless answers, but only a teacher can kindle the curiosity to ask the right questions. While algorithms may process data, it is teachers who invoke empathy, imagination, and the courage to think differently, and so their relevance is not measured by the information they carry, but by the wisdom, patience, and human touch with which they shape lives.Recognising this and honouring educators year after year, the Government of India confers the National Award to Teachers, bestowed annually since 1958. The Department of Higher Education, Ministry of Education, selected 21 teachers in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and Polytechnic this year. Among the recipients was Professor Iyer Vijayalaxmi Kasinath, a Chennaiite who teaches in the School of Planning and Architecture, Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh. From admitting she stumbled into architecture before falling in love with it, to playing a vital part in shaping climate-resilient and sustainable architecture curricula in India, her journey now aligns with the country’s international climate commitment. Here are excerpts from her candid conversation with CE. What inspired you to choose teaching as your path? Do you remember the teacher who inspired or made an impact on you to fuel that dream?I was in class 8. My brother had finished Engineering and cracked JEE, while my sister had joined MBBS. At that time, when my father asked what I wanted to pursue, I said I wanted to be a teacher. I didn’t know what I wanted to teach, but I think the decision came from the reverence and respect I had for my teachers in school.Later, in my undergraduate programme, I noticed certain traits in my professors that further inspired me to become a teacher myself. I had a professor named Ravi at Anna University. He taught me Basic Design in the first semester and Urban Design in my ninth semester. He was able to come down to the level of a first-semester B Arch student and also managed to relate to us in our final year of undergraduation. His way of teaching was fantastic that one could not take their eyes off the board. He was very punctual to class, and I have also never seen him lose his temper with his students. He would also never go out of his way to cajole students, but if you spoke to him, he would give you time. He was prepared before he came to class, and one could see his preparation, which means he respected his students and their time. All this was at a time when there was no real accountability system in education. There was no NAAC or NBA. I appreciated his passion and he was my biggest inspiration. So, the month I finished my post-graduation, I took up a teaching job. What led you to architecture? How did your interest evolve towards sustainable design?Frankly speaking, I wasn’t very passionate or keen on studying architecture. I had admission letters from multiple institutions outside Chennai after I finished school, but due to certain family situations, I wanted to be closer to home. Hence, I applied to Anna University and I got into the Architecture programme. Within a few weeks, when Professor Ravi taught us, I developed an interest in the subject.I was always very good at Mathematics. What I do today — sustainable architecture — has a lot of math in it. We have to calculate so many things — how energy transfer happens in buildings, how to make buildings comfortable, and so on. I think I found that sweet spot where my liking for architecture, which I had developed over a period of time, and my aptitude in Mathematics came together.What keeps you passionate about teaching after almost three decades in the profession?As teachers, we have the responsibility of training the next generation. When it comes to my domain of architecture, I believe that my generation has done immense damage to the environment. Now it is our duty to help the next generation mend that damage. This aligns with the agenda of the Government of India, which is to make India carbon neutral by 2070. But we have buildings that consume 40 percent of energy. So this gap of traversing to a net carbon-zero country is where, I think, I, as a teacher, am aiming to help students with. That keeps my fire burning. The National Award for Teachers winners with Prime Minister Narendra ModiIn promoting sustainable architectural practices in India, what major challenges do you think architects are encountering, and how should they address them?Firstly, compared to a decade ago, every architect has become aware of sustainability. Even clients have become aware of sustainable architecture, climate-responsive architecture, and that we need to be less energy intensive. But when a client invests his earnings of 30-35 years in a home, he has specificities that he would expect an architect to deliver, which might not be sustainable or help in keeping the building energy-intensive. So there is always the issue of meeting clients’ expectations. To tell them that they will have to live a slightly compromised life to have a sustainable building that doesn’t consume much energy is an issue for architects. That is the challenge they have — of convincing clients.But on the other side, there is a lot of work being done to make energy-neutral building materials. Materials are echo-labelled where the label says how much energy a product has consumed, carbon dioxide it has emitted, and so on. With such products, architects are quantifying the energy that they are consuming, but the confluence of everything isn’t happening today. It will take some time.Are there challenges when it comes to institutional mindsets of evolving architecture curriculum to accommodate sustainability?If you had asked me this question six months back, I would have said that there needs to be a great shift in the mindset. But recently, the Council of Architecture, which is the governing body for architectural education in India, made a separate team of experts to address the question of how to bring in sustainability and address climate change issues in the curriculum, especially the undergraduate one. I was a member too, and I think we have done as much to bring in three aspects — climate change, climate justice, and climate-based rehabilitation — into the curriculum of architecture.The National Award considers teaching-learning effectiveness and outreach. In your view, what makes your teaching effective and impactful?I believe that when a student learns, he shouldn’t just learn to write answers on a question paper. When he leaves, he should carry something significant in his hand. So I make every student go to the site and ask them to investigate the field, applying whatever was taught in theory. They should collect data, and it has to be interpolated. During this process, I also teach them technical writing. I facilitate their study by helping them procure instruments to study the data. Similarly, if there is a building that a student wants to study, and the owner refuses permission, I request them and facilitate the study. I end up handling each student on a one-to-one basis. I get WhatsApp messages at 2.30 am or 3 am saying “Ma’am, the instrument isn’t working” or “The weather was warm till yesterday and now due to thunderstorms the temperature has changed. Should I continue my reading?” My work is 24/7.Almost every student at the end of my course or subject has a technical paper worth publishing. It is then up to them how they want to take the paper forward — publish in journals or books, present it in conferences, or take it up as their PhD. Almost 80% of the students also end up taking the same topic as their dissertation and final thesis because they have invested so much thought, time, and energy into this work for my class. We often focus on new energy-efficient or climate-resilient buildings, but how does your work address making existing structures more sustainable?I teach sustainable architecture because India is a developing country and there is a huge demand for new buildings. In the next 50 years, there will be double the number of buildings. So there is a scope for them to be sustainable. But I also teach students how to retrofit old buildings with technology. That is a work in progress.For instance, how can we use nanotechnology or nano coatings to ensure heat from outside doesn’t come in? This becomes very important for heat-wave-prone places like Andhra Pradesh because disaster management guidelines ask people to stay inside, but the inside is so hot, and people who suffer are mainly women and children. Even those who work in industries like the cottage industry, for example, are already tackling heat stress. How do we make those buildings cool? We can’t say demolish and rebuild; that is where retrofitting comes into the picture. A large part of my research is about retrofitting.I also encourage students to study possibilities of retrofitting the buildings they study because if they take baby steps in one course and take it forward in their dissertation or thesis, when they start moving into the industry, they will think more about retrofitting buildings for energy efficiency.Can you imagine yourself doing anything else besides teaching?I am extremely passionate about my profession.

He warns that if no ch', 'content': 'The world we live in today carries the quiet touch of an engineer in every corner of life. Be it the roads we travel, the cars we ride, the elevators that carry us up, or even the invisible networks that connect us through the internet. Yet behind these conveniences lies a bigger question; are we preparing the next generation of engineers to meet global challenges? On September 15, as India celebrates National Engineer’s Day to mark the 164th birth anniversary of Bharat Ratna Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya, we turned to IIT Hyderabad Director Prof Budaraju Srinivasa Murty. He shares his thoughts on urgent reforms in engineering education, the need for innovation over rote learning, and how Indian engineers can stand shoulder to shoulder with the best in the world.ExcerptsAs the Director of IIT Hyderabad, what changes do you believe are most urgent to ensure India produces globally competitive engineers?That’s a very important question ahead of Engineer’s Day. To be honest, very few students today join IITs with the goal of becoming ‘engineers’. Most look for high-paying jobs, often in FinTech and multinational companies. In the past, students came to IITs aspiring to be good mechanical or electrical engineers. That spirit is slowly disappearing. So, the urgent reform is to bring back the culture of real engineering, doing things with one’s own hands. At IIT Hyderabad, we’ve started initiatives like:Innovation Support – Every semester, students can submit innovative project ideas. If selected, we fund them with Rs 1 lakh. They can even take a semester break (with credits) or a diploma break after the 2nd year to focus on their idea, with the option to return within 5 years.The Bharati Initiative – First-semester students are grouped (interdisciplinary) under faculty mentors. They meet weekly, brainstorm, and work hands-on. Students have already built projects like 8-bit computers from scratch.India must move from being only a service country to a product and technology country. I want to see our graduates working at companies like Qualcomm, Tata Motors or launching their own startups, rather than just standing in queues for Infosys or TCS. Already, 25% of IIT Hyderabad’s BTech students are into startups. Do you think India’s current engineering education is aligned with the skills and mindset needed for the industries of tomorrow?Unfortunately, not fully. Traditional branches like civil, mechanical, and electrical are shrinking in many colleges. If this continues, 20 years later, we may need to import engineers to build our bridges and roads. Institutions must work closely with industry and launch need-based programmes. At IIT Hyderabad, we have introduced:BTech in Computational Engineering (launched 2021) : India’s first interdisciplinary programme blending applied mathematics, solid/fluid mechanics, multi-scale modeling, etc, aimed at aerospace, automobiles, and manufacturing.BTech in Electrical Engineering (IC Design & Technology) (launched 2022) : To prepare students for India’s semiconductor mission, focusing on IC design and fabrication.BTech in Industrial Chemistry: To meet industry demand in petrochemicals, textiles, food processing, agriculture, etc, where strong chemistry knowledge is crucial.BTech in Engineering Sciences: A flexible, 130-credit programme where students design their own curriculum across multiple branches.\\uf06e We must also think of future-oriented programs: energy, smart mobility, renewable technologies, and sustainability. What gaps do you see between academic research in engineering and its real-world application in India?The gap is significant. Industries need real products and prototypes, not just papers. If brilliant IIT students vanish into software jobs, manufacturing suffers. At IIT Hyderabad, we try to close this gap through:The TiHAN Hub, where we developed and deployed AI-powered autonomous driverless buses on campus.Collaborative research in Beyond 5G and 6G technologies with international industry partners.Sustainability projects like biodegradable packaging films from sewage sludge and eggshell waste.Academic programmes must connect directly to industry needs.Apart from IITs, lakhs of graduates come out of private colleges every year. Why are those institutes unable to adopt such models?Many private universities actually have more autonomy than IITs. The issue is whether they use that freedom wisely. If they ask, ‘What does India really need?’ and redesign curricula accordingly, transformation is possible. We’ve shown proof of concept. In the past five years:320 startups were incubated at IIT Hyderabad, generating over Rs1,500 crore in revenue.580 patents were filed, with ~220 in the past year alone under our ‘Patent-a-Day’ mission.So, change is possible when institutions take responsibility.Can you share some contributions of Indian engineers in recent decades that you feel are globally underrated?There are many. For instance:Contributions in semiconductors and devices fabrication.India’s role in setting 5G standards, now recognised globally.Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, which was supplied worldwide.Such achievements must be highlighted more to inspire students. The world belongs to AI, what new opportunities will open for engineers in future?AI by itself is not valuable, it needs an application. The future belongs to Engineers + AI.For example: At IIT Hyderabad, we run an MTech in Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME), using AI to design new steels and materials. Our AI faculty come from diverse backgrounds — mechanical, civil, agriculture, electronics — not just computer science. So the future engineer will be someone who knows a core domain plus how to leverage AI in it.If you had the power to change one thing in India’s engineering education today, what would it be?Make education far more hands-on. Out of 130 BTech credits, at least 30–50 should be practical, project-based credits. That shift alone will transform India’s engineers.In your view, who are the greatest engineers India has produced?There are many. To name a few:Dr APJ Abdul Kalam – for his contributions in aerospace and defence.Sir M Visvesvaraya – a legendary civil engineer and statesman.Vikram Sarabhai, Satish Dhawan and other who shaped India’s space programme.Even physicists like Homi J Bhabha, who transformed into nation-builders.India has plenty of role models, we just need to recognise and celebrate them.What is your message to young engineers stepping into today’s uncertain world?Uncertainty exists only in the mind. If you truly enjoy engineering, like I enjoy metallurgy, you’ll always see opportunities. Students must be willing to learn continuously and apply their skills broadly, instead of chasing only one type of job.Finally, if Sir M Visvesvaraya were alive today, what message do you think he would give to engineers?He would tell us: ‘Jump into labs. Don’t sit only in front of computers. Build with your hands. That is how you make India great.’', 'pubDate': '2025-09-11 00:30:00', 'pubDateTZ': 'UTC', 'image_url': 'https://media.newindianexpress.com/newindianexpress/2025-09-10/0blhn03e/WhatsApp-Image-2025-09-10-at-11.55.36.jpeg', 'video_url': None, 'source_id': 'newindianexpress', 'source_name': 'The New Indian Express', 'source_priority': 15406, 'source_url': 'https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation', 'source_icon': 'https://n.bytvi.com/newindianexpress.jpg', 'language': 'english', 'country': ['india'], 'category': ['education', 'top'], 'sentiment': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'sentiment_stats': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_tag': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_region': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_org': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_summary': \"On National Engineer's Day, IIT Hyderabad Director Prof BS Murty emphasizes the need for urgent reforms in engineering education to produce globally competitive engineers.

Kirk, who served as chief executive and cofounder of the youth organization Turning Point USA, made frequent appearances on college campuses and in other settings, engaging in political dialogue with students in public settings. Several leaders who have survived public attacks or had family members victimized joined in bipartisan condemnation of the attack on Kirk. The former House speaker\\'s husband was seriously injured at their California home in 2022 by a man wielding a hammer , who authorities said was a believer in conspiracy theories. Pelosi, a Democrat, posted that “the horrific shooting today at Utah Valley University is reprehensible. Political violence has absolutely no place in our nation.” The president sustained a minor ear injury when he was shot at a campaign event last year. He was also the target of a failed assassination attempt while playing golf in Florida. He had a close relationship with Kirk and announced his death Wednesday on his Truth Social site. Trump described Kirk on Truth Social as a “great guy from top to bottom. GOD BLESS HIM!” He also posted, “No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie.\" President Trump also ordered all American flags to be lowered to half-staff until 6 p.m. ET Sunday. The former U.S. representative, a Democrat, suffered a serious brain injury from a 2011 shooting while meeting with constituents at a shopping center in her Arizona congressional district. She survived and has taken up the cause of fighting gun violence. Giffords posted on social media that she was “horrified” to hear of Kirk’s shooting. “Democratic societies will always have political disagreements,\" she wrote, \"but we must never allow America to become a country that confronts those disagreements with violence.\" The House majority leader, a Louisiana Republican, was shot at a practice for a charity baseball game involving members of Congress in the Virginia suburbs in 2017. The man who attacked Scalise had grievances against Trump and Republicans and was later fatally shot by police. Scalise asked people on the social media platform X to “please join me in praying for Charlie Kirk after this senseless act.” The Pennsylvania governor, a Democrat and potential national candidate, was evacuated with his family from the governor\\'s mansion earlier this year after a man broke into the building and set a fire that caused significant damage. “We must speak with moral clarity,\" Shapiro wrote on X. \"The attack on Charlie Kirk is horrifying and this growing type of unconscionable violence cannot be allowed in our society.” The Michigan governor, a Democrat, was the subject of a failed kidnapping plot by right-wing extremists who hoped to ignite a civil war. Two men were imprisoned for their 2020 attempt to kidnap the governor during her first term. “We should all come together to stand up against any and all forms of political violence,\" Whitmer wrote on social media. The Health and Human Services secretary appeared to invoke his family’s losses as he reacted to Kirk’s killing. Kennedy’s father, for whom he was named, was assassinated in 1968 as he sought the Democratic presidential nomination. Kennedy Sr. was an outspoken critic of the Vietnam War and an advocate for civil rights legislation as attorney general during his brother’s presidency and after John F. Kennedy’s assassination in 1963. “Once again, a bullet has silenced the most eloquent truth teller of an era,” Kennedy wrote on social media. He called Kirk a “relentless and courageous crusader for free speech.” Kirk’s killing follows instances of political violence in the United States in recent months, including the shooting of two different Minnesota state lawmakers and their spouses in June. Vance Boelter is accused of posing as a police officer and fatally shooting Minnesota House of Representatives Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark . Boelter also allegedly shot Minnesota Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, at their home in a nearby neighborhood. Hoffman and his wife survived the shooting. On Sen. Hoffman\\'s Facebook page, the Hoffman family released a statement, saying, \"America is broken, and political violence endangers our lives and democracy. The assassination of Charlie Kirk today is only the latest act that our country cannot continue to accept. Our leaders of both parties must not only tone down their own rhetoric, but they must begin to call out extreme, aggressive, and violent dialogue that foments these attacks on our republic and freedom. We also call on leaders of both parties to take immediate action to prevent gun violence. Our prayers are with the Kirk family, our state, and our country.\" Shortly after news broke that Kirk was shot, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, took to X, formerly known as Twitter, to offer condolences and decry political violence. \"An open forum for political dialogue and disagreement was upended by a horrific act of targeted violence. In America, we don’t settle our differences with violence or at gunpoint. I’m praying for Charlie, his family, and his young children,\" Walz wrote. U.S. Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith, both Minnesota Democrats, as well as Minnesota members of the U.S. House, posted to social media offering condolences and denouncing political violence.', 'pubDate': '2025-09-11 00:30:00', 'pubDateTZ': 'UTC', 'image_url': 'https://kubrick.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-2234744810-68c20fc9d63c3.jpg', 'video_url': None, 'source_id': 'wmur', 'source_name': 'Wmur', 'source_priority': 4547, 'source_url': 'https://www.wmur.com', 'source_icon': 'https://n.bytvi.com/wmur.png', 'language': 'english', 'country': ['united states of america'], 'category': ['top', 'politics'], 'sentiment': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'sentiment_stats': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_tag': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_region': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_org': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_summary': 'U.S. politicians, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, have expressed horror and sympathy following the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at a Utah event.

In testing, the EV reached a peak charging speed of 1014 kW, which is over 1 megawatt, a world first for passenger cars. To simplify it, the car absorbed as much energy in one minute as a Toyota RAV4 plug-in hybrid can hold in its entire battery. More impressive is that the GT XX managed to sustain that mega speed charging for over two and a half minutes. So, to pull this off, two breakthroughs made it possible: 1. A direct-cooled battery using special nonconductive oil to keep over 3,000 cells at the right temperature. 2. A liquid-cooled charging cable, which is originally designed for electric trucks, adapted for the car. This was surely a prototype setup with experimental equipment, but Mercedes says this is not just a science experiment. The direct-cooled battery technology will soon be in the production AMG GT and the brand’s upcoming AMG.EA platform. On the charging side, Mercedes is already working on 600-kW chargers for North America, inspired by this project. While it will take time for everyday drivers to see such speeds at public stations, this breakthrough chips away at one of the biggest complaints about EVs, that is long charging times.

Mariannette Miller-Meeks, part of a broader campaign to pressure House Republicans who voted against forcing the Department of Justice to release files related to late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, by blocking Democratic procedural maneuvers in the House. The new spots follow Monday’s release by the House Oversight Committee of a birthday album that included letters, signatures and names of high-profile figures, among them former President Bill Clinton and attorney Alan Dershowitz. It also includes a sexually suggestive letter to Epstein purportedly signed by President Donald Trump. Trump has denied writing the letter to Epstein, dismissing the document as a hoax and claiming his signature was forged. People are also reading...

The disgraced financier died by suicide in 2019 while in jail awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges. The DNC says its ads will run across several social media platforms in Iowa’s 1st Congressional District, highlighting what Democrats call Republican “cowardice” in shielding Trump from scrutiny. “If House Republicans can’t even stand up for the victims and survivors of a notorious sexual predator, then how can their voters trust them?” DNC chair Ken Martin said in a statement. The digital campaign is not the first time Democrats have sought to tie Iowa Republicans to the controversy over Epstein. In July, the DNC rolled out ads against U.S. Reps. Ashley Hinson and Zach Nunn, criticizing their opposition to Democratic-led efforts to force disclosure of the files. At the time, Democrats argued GOP lawmakers had broken with their own campaign trail promises to support transparency. The latest offensive underscores how national Democrats view the Epstein case as both a moral and political issue, particularly in battleground districts like Miller-Meeks’ Eastern Iowa seat. Republicans, for their part, have argued Democrats are using Epstein’s crimes for political gain, and have accused Democrats of being hypocritical, arguing that they could have called for the release of the files at any time while former President Joe Biden was in office. “We deserve transparency and honesty from our government,” Miller-Meeks said in a statement to The Gazette. “For four years, Joe Biden and Democrats ignored the opportunity to deliver truth. I stand with President Trump in his efforts to ensure transparency into Jeffrey Epstein’s heinous crimes while protecting the victims who endured so much abuse.” Emily Tuttle, a spokeswoman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, echoed Miller-Meeks. “Democrats could’ve spent their four years under Joe Biden fighting for victims, but instead tanked the economy, endangered communities with pro-crime policies, and opened our borders to illegal criminals all while covering up Biden’s decline,\" Tuttle said in a statement to The Gazette. \"Republicans will not be lectured on transparency or accountability by the Democrat Party.” The House fight over releasing the Epstein files has become an increasingly sharp point of partisan division. While some Republicans initially voiced support for disclosure, Democrats say most have since retreated under pressure from Trump. With control of the House on the line in 2026, the DNC’s renewed push signals it intends to keep the issue in the spotlight as part of its broader argument that Republicans are unwilling to stand up to the former president, even on matters involving transparency. More Republicans rally behind Hinson’s U.S. Senate campaign More Iowa Republicans are lining up behind U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson as she launches her campaign for U.S. Senate. Former Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad endorsed Hinson, praising her as “the proven conservative leader we need at this critical moment for our nation,” according to a social media post by Hinson’s campaign . “I have worked alongside Ashley and President Trump to enact policies that strengthen Iowa, unleash our economy, and protect our national security,” Branstad, who served as U.S. ambassador to China during Trump’s first term, said in a statement. “ ... In the United States Senate, Ashley will be a fearless ally of President Trump and a relentless fighter for the ‘America First’ agenda.” Joining Branstad in lending her support is fellow Republican Iowa U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks. “From fighting China’s growing influence to defending America\\'s jobs and families, Ashley has proven herself to be a warrior in Washington — and is ready to take the fight to the Senate,” Miller-Meeks said, according to a social media post by Hinson’s campaign . Hinson, who represents northeast Iowa’s 2nd District in the U.S. House, is vying to succeed retiring Iowa GOP U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst in the 2026 election. Ernst announced last week she will not seek a third term. Trump offered his “complete and total endorsement” of Hinson’s Senate bid via a Truth Social post Friday, praising her record in Iowa. Trump’s backing bolsters Hinson as the clear front-runner in the Republican primary, reinforcing her ties to the Trump-aligned MAGA base. The president’s early approval and Hinson’s growing list of endorsements could discourage additional challengers and help rally GOP unity behind Hinson. Hinson is one of two Republicans in the 2026 Senate race. The other is Jim Carlin, of Sioux City, a staunch pro-Trump conservative who criticized U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley for not pushing to investigate unsubstantiated allegations of widespread fraud in the 2020 presidential election. Carlin blasted Hinson as a “phony” after she received Trump’s endorsement, arguing she lacks credibility with Iowa conservatives. “Ashley Hinson never supported Trump and didn’t say one word on his behalf until after the caucuses. She is an actress reading D.C.’s script — she’s not a conservative, not America First and certainly not MAGA,” Carlin said in a statement. The Sioux City attorney and former state senator criticized Hinson’s record, citing her vote to certify the 2020 election, her support of former Rep. Liz Cheney as House Republican Conference chair, and backing for codifying same-sex marriage. Hinson, however, supported Cheney\\'s ouster from the position in 2021, after Cheney called out Trump and fellow Republicans for spreading false claims about the 2020 election. Hinson and other top House Republicans advocated for New York Rep. Elise Stefanik to replace Cheney in House GOP leadership. State Rep. Mark Cisneros, R-Muscatine, on Wednesday endorsed Carlin, praising his “principled leadership” and “unwavering commitment to conservative, constitutional values.” Carlin has also secured endorsements from Republican state Sens. Kevin Alons, Doug Campbell, Sandy Salmon and state Rep. Samantha Fett. The backing comes as Carlin positions himself as a grassroots conservative alternative to Hinson’s D.C.-backed bid. Joshua Smith, a former Libertarian, announced early this year he planned to run as a Republican to challenge Ernst in the GOP primary. Smith released a campaign ad, but has not yet filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to register a campaign for the seat. He created a skeleton campaign website with a brief bio and a “donate now” button that states: “Full website coming soon.” Grassley signals support for Hinson but stops short of endorsement Iowa Republican U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley on Wednesday praised Iowa GOP U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson as “fully qualified” to succeed retiring Iowa U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst but stopped short of a formal endorsement, saying his focus is on Republicans winning across the ballot in 2026. Asked directly if he would endorse Hinson’s Senate campaign, Grassley said he has worked with her during her years in the U.S. House and considers her well-prepared to seek the office. “Even though I’m disappointed Joni’s retiring, I think Ashley (is) fully qualified to succeed her, and I guess I’ll leave it at that at this point,” Grassley told reporters during a conference call. The state’s senior senator added that the party faces competitive races at the top of the ticket for both the Senate seat and governor and in two of Iowa’s congressional districts, and stressed unity. “The bottom line ... is that we’re going to win in 2026,” Grassley said. Lindsay James lands wave of Democratic endorsements for 2nd Congressional District State Rep. Lindsay James of Dubuque announced Wednesday she has secured endorsements from 30 Democratic leaders across Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District as she campaigns for the newly open U.S. House seat. Several Democratic candidates are in the field, including Cedar Rapids nonprofit leader Clint Twedt-Ball, veteran and former community college nursing dean Kathy Dolter of Cedar Rapids, and former state park manager Don Primus of Steamboat Rock. James’ backers include former U.S. Reps. Dave Loebsack and Abby Finkenauer, along with 27 current and former elected officials and activists. “I am proud to have earned the trust and support of this broad base of Democratic leaders representing every part of our district,” James said in a statement. “With their support ... we’re building the momentum and grassroots support needed to win this seat and build a stronger, fairer Iowa.” The endorsements come as the race turned into an open-seat election last week when Republican incumbent Ashley Hinson announced her intention to run for U.S. Senate. Republicans have a voter registration advantage of around 23,000 voters over Democrats in the district, which includes Cedar Rapids, Waterloo, Dubuque, Decorah, Grinnell and Mason City. President Donald Trump won the district by 10 percentage points in 2024, increasing his margin from 2020. National Democrats, however, have already targeted the district as competitive and see it as a top pickup opportunity in 2026. Loebsack, who represented the district for 14 years, praised James as a leader who “listens to people in communities large and small and works to improve their daily lives.” Finkenauer, who served one term in Congress before being defeated by Hinson in 2020, described James as a fighter who “never backs down” and is focused on working families.

तो जानिए, यह कैसे काम करता है। 1. एग्जीक्यूटिव क्रियाकलापों को मजबूत करता है : बहुभाषी व्यक्तियों को जानी-पहचानी भाषाओं को लगातार प्रबंधित और बदलते रहना होता है। इससे मस्तिष्क के एग्जीक्यूटिव कंट्रोल सिस्टम का व्यायाम होता है। इससे व्यक्ति के जीवन में ध्यान, कार्य-बदलाव और संयम जैसी क्षमताएं मजबूत होती हैं। 2. दिमाग की प्लास्टिसिटी बढ़ाता है : द्विभाषी और बहुभाषी व्यक्तियों के मस्तिष्क के कुछ क्षेत्रों में ‘ग्रे मैटर’ का घनत्व बढ़ा हुआ होता है। खासकर उन क्षेत्रों में, जो भाषा और एग्जीक्यूटिव कार्यों से संबंधित होते हैं। यह न्यूरोलॉजिकल प्लास्टिसिटी अथवा दिमाग की स्वयं को पुनर्गठित करने की क्षमता बढ़ती उम्र के साथ कॉग्निटिव तीक्ष्णता बनाए रखने में मदद करती है। कॉग्निटिव रिजर्व बढ़ाता है : माना जाता है कि कई भाषाएं सीखने और उपयोग करने के मस्तिष्क-उत्तेजक प्रभावों से कॉग्निटिव रिजर्व का निर्माण होता है। यह एक बफर जैसा है, जो लंबे समय तक बिना कोई लक्षण दिखाए दिमाग को न्यूरो डी-जनेरेटिव रोगों जैसे नुकसान को सहने की क्षमता देता है। हम इस न्यूरो डी-जनेरेटिव रोग को डिमेंशिया के रूप में भी जानते हैं। हां, कई भाषाएं सीखना और बोलना उल्लेखनीय ढंग से मस्तिष्क को उम्र संबंधी गिरावट से बचाता है। यह संज्ञानात्मक रूप से उम्रदराज होने और डिमेंशिया को विलंबित करता है। चूंकि कई भाषाओं को प्रबंधित करने में निरंतर संज्ञान संबंधी प्रयासों की जरूरत होती है, इसलिए बहुभाषी व्यक्ति अक्सर बेहतर कॉग्निटिव कार्यक्षमता का प्रदर्शन करते हैं- जिसमें एग्जीक्यूटिव कंट्रोल और ध्यान शामिल हैं। यह \"कॉग्निटिव रिजर्व\\' बहुभाषी दिमाग को लंबे समय तक मस्तिष्क के क्षय को झेलने के काबिल बनाता है। भाषा सीखने के मस्तिष्क पर होने वाले सकारात्मक प्रभाव बचपन तक सीमित नहीं हैं। वयस्क भी दूसरी या तीसरी भाषा सीखकर महत्वपूर्ण सुधार कर सकते हैं। ऐसा नहीं है कि बहुभाषी मस्तिष्क की उम्र नहीं बढ़ती, बल्कि इसके बजाय वे उम्र संबंधी बदलावों को सहन करने में अधिक बेहतर होते हैं। फंडा यह है कि शोध दिखाता है कि एकाग्रता और दिमागी चुस्ती वाले कार्यों में अक्सर बहुभाषी लोग एक भाषा जानने वालों से बेहतर प्रदर्शन करते हैं। कोई भी, किसी भी उम्र में नई भाषा सीख सकता है।', 'content': '\"हे भगवान, आप लोग किस स्पीड से बोलते हैं। लगता है जैसे यह तेज \"कैटामारन\\' उमड़ते समुद्र पर उड़ रही हो।\\' यह बात उन विदेशी पर्यटकों ने कही, जो हमारे साथ रामेश्वरम में दो पतवारों वाली नाव में बैठे थे। मेरे पिता ने शांत होकर उनसे कहा कि उन्होंने नाव के लिए जो शब्द \"कैटामारन\\' काम में लिया, वह उस तमिल भाषा का है- जो रामेश्वरम् और पूरे तमिलनाडु में बोली जाती है। फिर उन्होंने समझाया कि यह शब्द तमिल के \"कट्टुमरम\\' से लिया गया है, जिसका अर्थ है एक साथ बंधे हुए लट्ठे। इस तरह के शुरुआती डिजाइन मछली पकड़ने के लिए इस्तेमाल होते थे। उस विदेशी ने मेरे पिता की अंग्रेजी में दक्षता की तारीफ की, जो उसके अनुसार \"किसी अंग्रेज की तरह सटीक\\' थी। मुझे 70 के दशक में अपने माता-पिता के साथ यात्रा का यह किस्सा तब याद आया, जब इंदौर विश्वविद्यालय के एक छात्र ने मुझसे पूछा, \"आप इतने छोटे से छोटे दशमलव और कई संख्याओं को उनके प्रतिशत के साथ कैसे याद रखते हैं?

The strain was “among the most virulent” tested at Canada’s National Microbiology Laboratory and even low doses killed mice within a few days, the document says. But Furness says the CFIA doesn’t know how likely it is that the ostriches at the Edgewood farm remain infected, or will become infected. The document was filed on Tuesday with the Federal Court of Appeal, where the agency is arguing against another stay delaying the cull of about 400 ostriches. Katie Pasitney, farm spokeswoman and daughter of its co-owner, says in a Facebook post they are “actively responding” to filings by the Justice Department. “We are putting in our reconsideration material as well,” she says in the post on Wednesday, adding the farm would be providing further updates. The farm’s owners have long said the flock is healthy, acquiring “herd immunity” since the CFIA ordered the cull on Dec. 31, 2024, during an outbreak that went on to kill 69 birds. Furness’s filing follows a Federal Court of Appeal ruling granting the farm an interim stay and delaying the cull as it seeks a hearing at the Supreme Court of Canada.

She says the new information “increases the potential animal and human health risks associated with the ongoing delay” and “decontamination” of exposed areas. Furness says a review of scientific literature and information from a veterinary epidemiologist with the federal agency show ostriches can shed large amounts of avian influenza and continue shedding without showing signs of infection. “That is, infected ostriches may still be shedding virus through their urine, feces, and respiratory secretions, despite appearing healthy. This is referred to as ‘silent shedding’, which is also observed in some other birds, like ducks,” the filing says. Universal Ostrich Farms has repeatedly called for testing to determine whether the birds are infected with H5N1. Furness says the chances they are infected or will become infected “is unknown by CFIA, due to gaps in the available science regarding how long immunity to (avian influenza) viruses may last in an individual ostrich,” as well as a lack of information about how many ostriches were infected during the original outbreak. The affidavit says the requirements for a cull were met on Dec. 31, 2024, “and the policy does not provide for additional testing.” In any case, Furness says, testing could only provide additional evidence of current risk. It would not address the unknown risks of reinfection or the risks associated with the “contaminated environment,” she says in the document. Furness says the CFIA’s risk assessment is also informed by the farm owners’ “inability or unwillingness” to comply with quarantine rules. Avian influenza viruses can survive for months or even years in fresh water at low temperatures and have been documented surviving in manure and on feathers in low temperatures for about four to six months, the affidavit says. “Therefore, a source of infection or reinfection with (avian influenza) can remain in the environment long after individual infected birds have recovered,” it says. Universal Ostrich Farms has maintained the birds should be spared because they are scientifically valuable and pose no threat. The farm has lost in Federal Court and the Federal Court of Appeal, but last Thursday its lawyer sought another stay on the cull order, filing a series of documents as the farm pursues a hearing in Canada’s High Court. In a decision dated Sept. 6, the Appeal Court granted the interim stay until the stay motion “is decided on the basis of a full record.” The interim stay motion says the farm was to have until Wednesday to respond to the latest filings by the CFIA. It says the agency is still allowed to take preparatory steps to kill the birds. The CFIA says on its website that allowing a flock previously exposed to avian influenza to remain alive means a potential source of the virus persists and increases the risk of reassortment or mutation of the virus. The farm’s situation has drawn attention from officials in the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, including Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has repeatedly called for the animals to be spared and studied. Supporters seeking to avert a cull have also been camping out at the farm and staging concerts.', 'pubDate': '2025-09-11 00:29:34', 'pubDateTZ': 'UTC', 'image_url': 'https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/vancouversun/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cp174582015_298237803.jpg?h=216&quality=90&sig=oh_JtG5KaNN6_5uk0NsPBA&strip=all&w=288', 'video_url': None, 'source_id': 'vancouversun', 'source_name': 'Vancouver Sun', 'source_priority': 49420, 'source_url': 'https://vancouversun.com', 'source_icon': 'https://n.bytvi.com/vancouversun.png', 'language': 'english', 'country': ['canada'], 'category': ['health', 'top'], 'sentiment': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'sentiment_stats': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_tag': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_region': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_org': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_summary': \"A new analysis by Canada's deputy chief veterinarian, Dr. Cathy Furness, has confirmed that a unique and more lethal strain of avian influenza virus sickened about 400 ostriches at a B.C. farm.

Videos posted to social media show Kirk speaking into a handheld microphone at Utah Valley University in Sorensen Center courtyard, sitting under a white tent emblazoned with the slogans, “The American Comeback” and “Prove Me Wrong.” A single shot rings out and Kirk reaches up with his hand as a large volume of blood gushes from the left side of his neck. Stunned spectators gasp and scream. Some run away. The shooting quickly drew reaction from leading political figures, including some victims of political violence. Here’s the latest: Moments before the shooting Video shows Kirk had been taking questions from an audience member about mass shootings and gun violence. “Do you know how many transgender Americans have been mass shooters over the last 10 years?” an audience member asked. Kirk responded, “Too many.” The questioner followed up: “Do you know how many mass shooters there have been in America over the last 10 years?” “Counting or not counting gang violence?” Kirk asked. Then a single shot rang out. Thousands turned out for Kirk’s appearance and police were also present Jeff Long, chief of Utah Valley University Police Department, says six officers working at Kirk’s campus event and more than 3,000 people were in attendance. The police chief says his officers coordinated their operation with Kirk’s security team, and plainclothes police officers were also present. At the time he was shot, Kirk was speaking to the throng in a low area surrounded by campus buildings. Long said law enforcement tries to get the “bases covered.” But he added, “unfortunately today we didn’t, and because of that we have this tragic incident.” Students, meanwhile, told The Associated Press they saw no metal detectors or bag checks. The amount of security appeared consistent with other speaking engagements on Kirk’s national tour. Suspect released, shooter still at large: FBI director The suspect in the killing of Charlie Kirk has been released after an interrogation with law enforcement, according to FBI Director Kash Patel. “The subject in custody has been released after an interrogation by law enforcement. Our investigation continues and we will continue to release information in interest of transparency,” Patel said in a post on X. Tammy Ibrahimpoor, CTV News producer FBI appeals to the public for information about the shooting The FBI’s Salt Lake City office has added an online form to its website where the public can report information about Kirk’s killing. The form says the FBI is “seeking information regarding the shooting at Utah Valley University that took place on September 10, 2025.” It asks the person submitting the form to include their name and contact information and then includes a section for information about the incident. Donald Trump Jr. says Kirk wasn’t a threat to anyone In a lengthy social media post, President Trump’s son says Kirk wasn’t just a friend, but was “like a little brother to me” and a “true inspiration.” Trump Jr. said Kirk “changed the direction of this nation” because “there is no question that Charlie’s work and his voice helped my father win the presidency.” He said Kirk was civil and kind, and listened and responded with respect. “The only `threat’ he ever posed was that he was incredibly effective. He was a powerful messenger of truth, and people heard that truth. That’s what made him a target.” Democrats in Congress mourn Kirk Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell of Michigan appeared visibly upset while speaking to reporters on the steps of the U.S. Capitol. She said that she cried when she found out that Kirk had died. “All of us have got to work together and deescalate the heat and the rhetoric in this country, she said. Dingell added: “And remember we’re Americans, and you can disagree in a way that doesn’t end in the horrible way today did.” Rep. Jamie Raskin expressed condolences to Kirk’s family, adding, “What a nightmare this whole thing is.” “It’s a very dark time with the political violence spiraling out of control and gun violence a threat to everybody,” Raskin continued. Utah governor says Kirk’s death carries a tragic message for the state of the country Gov. Spencer Cox said that Kirk had come to the Utah Valley University campus to represent his conservative views and debate. Targeting people for their ideas threatens the country’s “constitutional foundations,” he said. “We just need every single person in this country to think about where we are and where we want to be,” he said. “I don’t care what his politics are. I care that he was an American.” Cox said the first of the inalienable rights enshrined in the Declaration of Independence is “life, and today a life was taken. Charlie Kirk was first and foremost a husband and a dad to young children. He was also very much politically involved. And that’s why he was here on campus. Charlie believed in the power of free speech and debate to shape ideas and to persuade people.” President of the university where Kirk was killed calls his death tragic Utah Valley University President Astrid Tuminez posted on X that the school is “shocked and saddened” by Kirk’s death. She expressed her condolences to his family and said they are grieving with the many people from the school who saw the “unspeakable tragedy” unfold. “We firmly believe that UVU is a place to share ideas and to debate openly and respectfully. Any attempt to infringe on those rights has no place here,” the statement said. Kirk backers leave flowers at Turning Point headquarters The flags outside Turning Point USA’s Phoenix headquarters have been lowered to half staff. Bouquets of flowers delivered by well-wishers are piling up by the main door to one of at least three buildings that make up Turning Point’s campus. The organization’s presence has grown steadily in a quiet neighborhood at the base of South Mountain park. Former President George W. Bush says violence must be `purged from the public square’ Bush lamented the killing and said “an open exchange of opposing ideas should be sacrosanct” on a college campus, where Kirk was shot. In his statement, Bush added: “Members of other political parties are not our enemies; they are our fellow citizens.” The Republican ex-president closed the statement by asking God to bless Kirk and his family and “guide America toward civility.” Another former president, Democrat Bill Clinton, wrote on X that he was saddened and angered by the killing, adding he hoped “we all go through some serious introspection” and “redouble our efforts to engage in debate passionately, yet peacefully.” Kirk follower says he went to Turning Point USA’s headquarters to give large donation in person Retiree Alex Lane said news of Kirk’s killing prompted him to head to the organization’s Phoenix headquarters and hand the organization a $10,000 check. “I hope and trust that they’re going to continue with the message that he had,” Lane, 54, told The Associated Press while standing outside the headquarters. Lane said he was a follower of Kirk’s and had given to Turning Point before, but never such a large sum. “It’s a huge loss, there’s no question about it,” Lane said. “But I think the important thing for people to understand is that (Kirk’s message) is going to continue. The assassin didn’t stop it. If anything, I think it will bring more attention to his message.” Lawmakers reflect on Kirk’s influence Multiple Republicans in Congress knew Kirk personally and were devastated by his death. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida spoke on the Capitol steps, reflecting on his influence on her political journey. Luna said she was planning to go to medical school before Kirk recruited her to work as his national Hispanic outreach director. She attended events where Kirk debated students, like the one he hosted today. “That conversation needs to happen,” Luna said. “You can’t squelch that.” Kirk killed with single shot in supposed targeted attack, authorities say Utah Gov. Spencer Cox called the killing a “political assassination.” A “person of interest” was in custody Wednesday evening, Cox said, though no charges were immediately announced. “This is a dark day for our state,” Cox said. “We are actively looking for anyone and everyone who has any information related to the shooting,” he said. Utah authorities said the shooter wore dark clothing and fired from a roof on campus some distance away. RFK Jr., son and nephew of assassinated leaders, laments another loss Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appeared to invoke his family’s losses as he reacted to Kirk’s killing. “Once again, a bullet has silenced the most eloquent truth teller of an era,” Kennedy wrote on social media. He called Kirk a “relentless and courageous crusader for free speech.” Kennedy’s father, for whom he was named, was assassinated in 1968 as he sought the Democratic presidential nomination. The elder Kennedy was an outspoken critic of the Vietnam War before many elected leaders in Washington. He also had been an advocate for civil rights legislation as attorney general during his brother’s presidency and after John F. Kennedy’s assassination in 1963. Person suspected in fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk now in custody, FBI director says The person suspected of fatally shooting conservative activist Charlie Kirk on a Utah college campus Wednesday is now in custody, according to a social media post from FBI Director Kash Patel. Kirk fans pay their respects at the Turning Point headquarters in Phoenix One man delivered flowers and wiped tears from his face as he left. He said he was too broken up to speak to reporters. On the sidewalk, 14-year-old Samuel Monahan embraced his parents in prayer. “This is what happens when we’re without God,” said Monahan. The teenager said he admired Kirk for being a man of God who cared about people. The country is so polarized, he said, “but it didn’t have to be that way because we all bow our heads under one flag and under one God.” Former President Obama condemns Kirk’s `despicable’ killing “This kind of despicable violence has no place in our democracy,” former President Barack Obama wrote on X. He said he and former first lady Michelle Obama will pray for Kirk’s wife and two young children. Chaffetz says he’s angry about Kirk’s death “It makes me mad. I’m so mad that this happened in our backyard. It’s an embarrassment,” the Utah Republican former member of Congress told Fox News Channel. Chaffetz was at the event where Kirk was shot. “We’re better than this, but there’s somebody out there who is evil, absolute total, complete evil and they need to be taken down,” he said. Kirk’s appearance at Utah Valley University marked the kickoff of his national college tour He was calling it “The American Comeback Tour.” And he was featuring his “Prove Me Wrong Table,” where Kirk sat, as he was Wednesday, and fielded questions from students, including those who disagreed with him. He also had appearances slated for Colorado State University, the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, Virginia Tech University, Utah State University, the University of North Dakota, Montana State University, Indiana University Louisiana State University and the University of Mississippi over the next two months. The scene around campus Armed officers are walking around the neighborhood bordering the campus, knocking on doors and asking for information on the shooter. Officers have been seen looking at a photo on their phones and showing it to people to see if they recognize a person of interest. Mayor urges people to report anything suspicious Mayor David Young of the north-central Utah city of Orem says several local, state and federal law enforcement agencies are investigating and that the suspect in Kirk’s shooting remains at large. Young says police in Orem and at Utah Valley University are among many agencies involved in the investigation. Meanwhile, authorities have told anyone at Utah Valley University to ‘secure in place’ after Wednesday’s shooting. The campus was closed, and a post on the school’s emergency information page told those still on campus to call officials to be escorted out. An increase in violence against public officials Kirk’s killing follows instances of political violence in the United States in recent months, including the assassination of a Democratic Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband in June and the fatal shooting of two Israeli Embassy staffers in Washington in May. Though little is known about the shooter or the motive in this case, it can’t be ignored that polarization and normalization of violence have become threaded through U.S. politics, said Kurt Braddock, an assistant professor of public communication at American University. Braddock pointed to data from Princeton University’s Bridging Divides Initiative, which shows that threat and harassment incidents against local officials also have been gradually increasing. “We’re moving in a very dangerous direction, and I think we have been moving in this direction for quite some time,” Braddock said. Charlie Kirk is dead, Trump says Trump says the conservative activist and his close ally died Wednesday after being shot at a college event in Utah. The president posted on Truth Social that the conservative activist and his close ally died Wednesday after being shot at a college event in Utah. “No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie. He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us.” Person arrested is not a suspect, AP source says A person who was taken into custody at Utah Valley University was not the suspect, according to a person familiar with the investigation who was not authorized to speak publicly. It was not clear if authorities were still searching the campus for a suspect. Michelle L. Price Trump says Kirk ‘was a very, very good friend’ In a phone interview with the New York Post, Trump said Kirk is “not doing well” and “it looks very bad.” “He was a very, very good friend of mine and he was a tremendous person,” Trump said. Kirk invite to Dartmouth College campus was in demand: school president Dartmouth College President Sian Beilock says a bipartisan student group invited Kirk to that Ivy League campus for a Sept. 25 event. Beilock says the event “was sold out within 10 minutes.” Beilock made the comment during a media event Wednesday with other college presidents. Victims of political violence show support for Kirk Former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, posted that “the horrific shooting today at Utah Valley University is reprehensible. Political violence has absolutely no place in our nation.” Pelosi’s husband was seriously injured in 2022 by a man wielding a hammer, who authorities said was a believer in conspiracy theories. Former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who suffered a serious brain injury in a 2011 shooting in Arizona, said she was “horrified” to hear of Kirk’s shooting. “Democratic societies will always have political disagreements, but we must never allow America to become a country that confronts those disagreements with violence,” she said on social media. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat and potential national candidate, said, “We must speak with moral clarity. The attack on Charlie Kirk is horrifying and this growing type of unconscionable violence cannot be allowed in our society.” A fire was set at his house. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who was the subject of a kidnapping plot, said on social media that “we should all come together to stand up against any and all forms of political violence.” Two men were imprisoned for their 2020 plot to kidnap the governor during her first term. A Republican at the event says he heard one shot A former U.S. representative for Utah’s 3rd congressional district, Jason Chaffetz, says when the shot rang out, Kirk had just been asked a question by someone in the crowd about transgender people and shootings. “As soon as I saw Charlie go back, you realize that it was a shot,” Chaffetz says. “It wasn’t as if there was a whole bunch of gunfire. It was one shot.” Elected officials react to the shooting U.S. Vice-President JD Vance: “Dear God, protect Charlie in his darkest hour.” Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg: “Political violence must be always and totally rejected,” Buttigieg wrote on X. “Praying for him and all who may have been injured or impacted.” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker: “The attack on Charlie Kirk is horrifying. Political violence has no place in this country and should never become the norm. I’m sending my sympathies to his family and friends at this time.” Former North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper: “Violence is unacceptable. I strongly condemn the attack on Charlie Kirk and political violence in all forms. I’m praying for his swift recovery.” New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani: “I’m horrified by the shooting of Charlie Kirk at a college event in Utah. Political violence has no place in our country.” North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein: “We can never tolerate or become numb to political violence. Our nation is weaker when people are afraid to share their opinions or disagree. Please join Anna and me in praying for Charlie Kirk’s recovery.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: “Praying for @charliekirk11′′ Maryland Gov. Wes Moore: “I condemn in the strongest possible terms the attack on Charlie Kirk this afternoon at Utah Valley University. As I have said in the past and as I will continue to say: Political violence is never acceptable. Ever.” Kirk is in critical condition A law enforcement official briefed on the shooting told The Associated Press that Kirk is being treated and is in critical condition. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. By Alana Durkin Richer Utah Valley University is the state’s largest public university With nearly 47,000 students, Utah Valley University has grown to become the largest public university in Utah. It’s located about 40 miles (65 kilometres) south of Salt Lake City, the state capital, and was founded in 1941 as a vocation school. From those beginnings, its enrollment has jumped five-fold over the past three decades. The college is not affiliated or owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, known widely as the Mormon church. Bipartisan rejections of political violence continue Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat and a potential 2028 presidential candidate, called the shooting “chilling & horrific” in an X post. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, another Democrat and potential national candidate, said, “We must speak with moral clarity. The attack on Charlie Kirk is horrifying and this growing type of unconscionable violence cannot be allowed in our society.” Republican Senate Leader John Thune of South Dakota posted: “There is no place in our country for political violence. Period, full stop.” Gabby Giffords says she is horrified about the shooting Giffords, a former U.S. representative for Arizona who suffered a serious brain injury when she was shot in 2011, posted on X about the attack on Kirk. “I’m horrified to hear that Charlie Kirk was shot at an event in Utah,” she wrote Wednesday. “Democratic societies will always have political disagreements, but we must never allow America to become a country that confronts those disagreements with violence.” Kirk was speaking at a debate hosted by Turning Point USA when he was shot The event at Utah Valley University had been met with divided opinions on campus. An online petition calling for university administrators to bar Kirk from appearing receiving nearly 1,000 signatures. The university issued a statement last week citing First Amendment rights and affirming its “commitment to free speech, intellectual inquiry, and constructive dialogue.” U.S. President Trump said on Truth Social that “we must all pray for Charlie Kirk.” “A great guy from top to bottom. GOD BLESS HIM!” the president said in a post on Truth Social. FBI Director Kash Patel said the FBI is “closely monitoring reports of the tragic shooting involving Charlie Kirk.” U.S. Vice-President JD Vance also called for prayers, calling Charlie Kirk “a genuinely good guy and a young father.” Health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Attorney General Pam Bondi, and House Speaker Mike Johnson joined the chorus of Trump officials offering their prayers to Kirk. Support also came from across the aisle. California Gov. Gavin Newsom called the shooting “disgusting, vile, and reprehensible. In the United States of America, we must reject political violence in EVERY form.” Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said: “Political violence has absolutely no place in our nation.” Aubrey Laitsch at Turning Point USA confirms Charlie Kirk has been hospitalized. “He is in the hospital, and we are praying for him at this time,” said Aubrey Laitsch, public relations manager for Turning Point USA. Former Utah congressman says Kirk had some security but not enough Jason Chaffetz, a Republican who was at the event, said told Fox News Channel that he heard one shot and saw Kirk go back. “It seemed like it was a close shot,” Chaffetz said, who seemed shaken as he spoke. He said there was a light police presence at the event and Kirk had some security but not enough. “Utah is one of the safest places on the planet,” he said. “And so we just don’t have these types of things.”', 'pubDate': '2025-09-11 00:28:07', 'pubDateTZ': 'UTC', 'image_url': 'https://www.ctvnews.ca/resizer/v2/YMFFB4VNYNASPJDNE4VDOKQ3NQ.jpg?auth=91f81cdcce3ab71c878b0f381f1c825877cde79bf75e82c3e4865b25a77809b5&height=630&smart=true&width=1200', 'video_url': None, 'source_id': 'ctvnews', 'source_name': 'Ctv News', 'source_priority': 5458, 'source_url': 'https://regina.ctvnews.ca', 'source_icon': 'https://n.bytvi.com/ctvnews.png', 'language': 'english', 'country': ['canada'], 'category': ['crime', 'top'], 'sentiment': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'sentiment_stats': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_tag': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_region': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_org': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_summary': \"Charlie Kirk, CEO of Turning Point USA, was fatally shot at a Utah college event.

While in-depth analysis is needed of the sample gathered there by Perseverance, science mission chief Nicky Fox said it was the \"closest we\\'ve actually come to discovering ancient life on Mars\". A green glow snapped from Mars marks the first time that an aurora has been observed from the surface of another planet. The rover, which has been roaming Mars since 2021, cannot directly detect life, past or present. Instead, it carries a drill to penetrate rocks and tubes to hold the samples gathered from places judged most suitable for having hosted life billions of years ago. Calling it an \"exciting discovery\", a pair of scientists who were not involved in the study — The SETI Institute\\'s Janice Bishop and the University of Massachusetts Amherst\\'s Mario Parente — told the Associated Press that non-biological processes could be responsible. \"That\\'s part of the reason why we can\\'t go so far as to say, \\'A-ha, this is proof positive of life,\\'\\'\\' lead researcher Joel Hurowitz of Stony Brook University told The Associated Press. \"All we can say is one of the possible explanations is microbial life, but there could be other ways to make this set of features that we see.\" Either way, Dr Hurowitz said it was the best, most compelling candidate yet in the rover\\'s search for potential signs of long-ago life. It was the 25th sample gathered: the tally is now up to 30. The findings appeared in the journal Nature . \"It would be amazing to be able to demonstrate conclusively that these features were formed by something that was alive on another planet billions of years ago, right?\" Dr Hurowitz said. But even if that is not the case, it is \"a valuable lesson in all of the ways that nature can conspire to fool us\". Collected last summer, the sample is from reddish, clay-rich mudstones in Neretva Vallis, a river channel that once carried water into Jezero Crater. This outcrop of sedimentary rock, known as the Bright Angel formation, was surveyed by Perseverance\\'s scientific instruments before the drill came out. Along with organic carbon, a building block of life, Dr Hurowitz and his team found minuscule specks, dubbed poppy seeds and leopard spots, that were enriched with iron phosphate and iron sulphide. On Earth, these chemical compounds are by-products of microorganisms chomping down on organic matter. \"There is no evidence of microbes on Mars today, but if any had been present on ancient Mars, they too might have reduced sulphate minerals to form sulphides in such a lake at Jezero Crater,\" Dr Bishop and Dr Parente wrote in an accompanying editorial. The samples are awaiting retrieval to Earth — an ambitious plan that is on hold as NASA seeks cheaper, quicker options. Perseverance\\'s hunt for signs of life Perseverance sent this selfie back to Earth in 2024. ( Supplied: NASA ) There is no evidence of present-day life on Mars, but NASA has over the decades sent spacecraft to Mars in search of past watery environments that might have supported life way back when. When Perseverance launched in 2020, NASA expected the samples back on Earth by the early 2030s. But that date slipped into the 2040s as costs swelled to $11 billion, stalling the retrieval effort. Until the samples are transported off of Mars by robotic spacecraft or astronauts, scientists will have to rely on Earthly stand-ins and lab experiments to evaluate the feasibility of ancient Martian life, according to Hurowitz. NASA\\'s acting administrator Sean Duffy said budgets and timing would dictate how best to proceed, and even raised the possibility of sending sophisticated equipment to Mars to analyse the samples on the red planet. \"All options are on the table,\" he said. Ten of the titanium sample tubes gathered by Perseverance were placed on the Martian surface a few years ago as a backup to the rest aboard the rover, all part of NASA\\'s still fuzzy return mission.

International surveys show people are shopping for more protein because they think it’ll help their fitness and health. But clever marketing can sway our judgement too. Before your next shop, here’s what you should know about how protein is allowed to be sold to us. And as a food and nutrition scientist, I’ll offer some tips for choosing the best value meat or plant-based protein for every $1 you spend – and no, protein bars aren’t the winner.‘Protein’ vs ‘increased protein’ claimsLet’s start with those “high protein” or “increased protein” claims we’re seeing more of on the shelves. In Australia and New Zealand, there are actually rules and nuances about how and when companies can use those phrases.Under those rules, labelling a product as a “protein” product implies it’s a “source” of protein. That means it has at least 5 grams of protein per serving. “High protein” doesn’t have a specific meaning in the food regulations, but is taken to mean “good source”. Under the rules, a “good source” should have at least 10 grams of protein per serving.Then there is the “increased protein” claim, which means it has at least 25% more protein than the standard version of the same food. If you see a product labelled as a “protein” version, you might assume it has significantly more protein than the standard version. But this might not be the case.Take, for example, a “protein”-branded, black-wrapped cheese: Mini Babybel Protein. It meets the Australian and New Zealand rules of being labelled as a “source” of protein, because it has 5 grams of protein per serving (in this case, in a 20 gram serve of cheese). But what about the original red-wrapped Mini Babybel cheese? That has 4.6g of protein per 20 gram serving.The difference between the original vs “protein” cheese is not even a 10% bump in protein content. Black packaging by designFood marketers use colours to give us signals about what’s in a package.Green signals natural and environmentally friendly, reds and yellows are often linked to energy, and blue goes with coolness and hydration. These days, black is often used as a visual shorthand for products containing protein. But it’s more than that. Research also suggests black conveys high-quality or “premium” products. This makes it the perfect match for foods marketed as “functional” or “performance-boosting”.The ‘health halo’ effectWhen one attribute of a food is seen as positive, it can make us assume the whole product is health-promoting, even if that’s not the case. This is called a “health halo”.For protein, the glow of the protein halo can make us blind to the other attributes of the food, such as added fats or sugars. We might be willing to pay more too.It’s important to know protein deficiency is rare in countries like Australia. You can even have too much protein. How to spend less to get more proteinIf you do have good reason to think you need more protein, here’s how to get better value for your money.Animal-based core foods are nutritionally dense and high-quality protein foods. Meats, fish, poultry, eggs, fish, and cheese will have between 11 to 32 grams of protein per 100 grams.That could give you 60g in a chicken breast, 22g in a can of tuna, 17g in a 170g tub of Greek yoghurt, or 12g in 2 eggs. In the animal foods, chicken is economical, delivering more than 30g of protein for each $1 spent. But you don’t need to eat animal products to get enough protein.In fact, once you factor in costs – and I made the following calculations based on recent supermarket prices – plant-based protein sources become even more attractive. Legumes (such as beans, lentils and soybeans) have about 9g of protein per 100g, which is about half a cup. Legumes are in the range of 20g of protein per dollar spent, which is a similar cost ratio to a protein powder. Nuts, seeds, legumes and oats are all good plant-based options. Towfiqu Barbhuiya/Unsplash, CC BY Nuts and seeds like sunflower seeds can have 7g in one 30g handful. Even one cup of simple frozen peas will provide about 7g of protein.Peanuts at $6 per kilogram supply 42g of protein for each $1 spent. Dry oats, at $3/kg have 13g of protein per 100g (or 5g in a half cup serve), that’s 33g of protein per dollar spent. In contrast, processed protein bars are typically poor value, coming in at between 6-8g of protein per $1 spent, depending on if you buy them in a single serve, or in a box of five bars. Fresh often beats processed on price and proteinPackaged products offer convenience and certainty. But if you rely on convenience, colours and keywords alone, you might not get the best deals or the most nutritious choices. Choosing a variety of fresh and whole foods for your protein will provide a diversity of vitamins and minerals, while reducing risks associated with consuming too much of any one thing.

            "記者施春美/台北報導 一般人自覺健忘、專注力下降,多歸咎於年紀問題,但營養師薛曉晶表示,一項研究發現,常吃超加工食品(UPF)的人,認知功能下降速度比低攝取組快28%,執行功能更下降25%。另一項研究也指出,吃大量超加工食品與失智症風險增加44%有關。此外,每天吃大量超加工食品的人出現巴金森氏症狀是少吃者的2.5倍。 現代生活講求快速,速食、微波餐等看似方便,但薛曉晶在其 臉書 表示,科學已證實,這些「超加工食品」(UPF)正逐步侵蝕人的認知功能與情緒迴路。 2019年《Public Health Nutrition》專文指出,UPF多為工業配方,富含高糖、高鹽、高油及添加物,而原型食材比例極低。 2023年《JAMA Neurology》研究追蹤逾萬名35~74歲成年人長達8年,結果發現,高UPF飲食組的認知功能下降速度比低攝取組快28%,執行功能也下降25%。這意味,長期依賴UPF會讓「腦力退化」提早報到。 另一項研究也證實,中年人每多攝取10% UPF,未來發生輕度認知障礙或失智的風險就會上升;若能以天然食物替代部分UPF,失智風險則顯著降低。 失智症不再是老年專屬 中年飲食習慣才是關鍵 薛曉晶表示,2024年《Journal of Neurology》統合分析超過50萬人數據,發現高UPF攝取與罹患失智症(含阿茲海默症、血管型失智)風險增加44%有關。2025年哈佛與復旦大學研究顯示,每日攝取約11份UPF的人,出現巴金森氏症早期非運動症狀(如便秘、睡眠障礙)的風險,是低攝取者的2.5倍。「這些都顯示UPF可能在無形中加速神經退化。」 至於UPF會如此傷腦,薛曉晶表示,研究者提出3大關鍵機制: 1. 慢性發炎 :UPF的高糖、高脂、乳化劑及人工甜味劑等成分,會引發低度慢性發炎,進而導致神經發炎,加速阿茲海默與巴金森氏症的病理進展。 2. 氧化壓力 :油炸與高溫加工產生自由基,會使腦細胞DNA與膜結構受損,導致腦萎縮。 3. 腸腦軸失衡 :2025年《Nutrients》(營養素)研究指出,UPF會改變腸道菌群,減少益菌,增加腸道通透性,引發全身性發炎,進而透過「腸腦軸」影響情緒與認知。 她表示,超加工食品的危害不僅是體重增加,更是大腦功能的全面退化,涵括認知下降到失智症。民眾應從此刻起多吃原型食物、少吃超加工食品,大腦會用更清晰的思緒、更穩定的情緒,來回報自己。 \n",

            "Charlie Kirk, the CEO and co-founder of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA, was fatally shot Wednesday while speaking at an event at a Utah college, officials said. A “person of interest” was in custody Wednesday evening, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said, though no charges were immediately announced. Videos posted to social media show Kirk speaking into a handheld microphone at Utah Valley University in Sorensen Center courtyard, sitting under a white tent emblazoned with the slogans, “The American Comeback” and “Prove Me Wrong.” A single shot rings out and Kirk reaches up with his hand as a large volume of blood gushes from the left side of his neck. Stunned spectators gasp and scream. Some run away. The shooting quickly drew reaction from leading political figures, including some victims of political violence. Here’s the latest: After Kirk’s killing, security measures heightened for 9/11 anniversary events in New York New York City police say the killing in Utah is prompting added security for events in the city marking the 24th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. Vice President JD Vance is set to attend tomorrow’s memorial ceremony at the World Trade Center site while President Donald Trump is scheduled to be at the night game pitting the Yankees against the Tigers. Security around the 9/11 commemorations in New York is always comprehensive, with street closures, a large police presence and the Sept. 11 memorial plaza in Lower Manhattan closed to the public. Officials didn’t detail exactly how security would be increased. Moments before the shooting Video shows Kirk had been taking questions from an audience member about mass shootings and gun violence. “Do you know how many transgender Americans have been mass shooters over the last 10 years?” an audience member asked. Kirk responded, “Too many.” The questioner followed up: “Do you know how many mass shooters there have been in America over the last 10 years?” “Counting or not counting gang violence?” Kirk asked. Then a single shot rang out. Thousands turned out for Kirk’s appearance and police were also present Jeff Long, chief of Utah Valley University Police Department, says six officers working at Kirk’s campus event and more than 3,000 people were in attendance. The police chief says his officers coordinated their operation with Kirk’s security team, and plainclothes police officers were also present. At the time he was shot, Kirk was speaking to the throng in a low area surrounded by campus buildings. Long said law enforcement tries to get the “bases covered.” But he added, “unfortunately today we didn’t, and because of that we have this tragic incident.” Students, meanwhile, told The Associated Press they saw no metal detectors or bag checks. The amount of security appeared consistent with other speaking engagements on Kirk’s national tour. Suspect released, shooter still at large: FBI director The suspect in the killing of Charlie Kirk has been released after an interrogation with law enforcement, according to FBI Director Kash Patel. The subject in custody has been released after an interrogation by law enforcement. Our investigation continues and we will continue to release information in interest of transparency https://t.co/YXsG6YpFR5 “The subject in custody has been released after an interrogation by law enforcement. Our investigation continues and we will continue to release information in interest of transparency,” Patel said in a post on X. Tammy Ibrahimpoor, CTV News producer FBI appeals to the public for information about the shooting The FBI’s Salt Lake City office has added an online form to its website where the public can report information about Kirk’s killing. The form says the FBI is “seeking information regarding the shooting at Utah Valley University that took place on September 10, 2025.” It asks the person submitting the form to include their name and contact information and then includes a section for information about the incident. Donald Trump Jr. says Kirk wasn’t a threat to anyone In a lengthy social media post, President Trump’s son says Kirk wasn’t just a friend, but was “like a little brother to me” and a “true inspiration.” Trump Jr. said Kirk “changed the direction of this nation” because “there is no question that Charlie’s work and his voice helped my father win the presidency.” He said Kirk was civil and kind, and listened and responded with respect. “The only `threat’ he ever posed was that he was incredibly effective. He was a powerful messenger of truth, and people heard that truth. That’s what made him a target.” Democrats in Congress mourn Kirk Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell of Michigan appeared visibly upset while speaking to reporters on the steps of the U.S. Capitol. She said that she cried when she found out that Kirk had died. “All of us have got to work together and deescalate the heat and the rhetoric in this country, she said. Dingell added: “And remember we’re Americans, and you can disagree in a way that doesn’t end in the horrible way today did.” Rep. Jamie Raskin expressed condolences to Kirk’s family, adding, “What a nightmare this whole thing is.” “It’s a very dark time with the political violence spiraling out of control and gun violence a threat to everybody,” Raskin continued. Utah governor says Kirk’s death carries a tragic message for the state of the country Gov. Spencer Cox said that Kirk had come to the Utah Valley University campus to represent his conservative views and debate. Targeting people for their ideas threatens the country’s “constitutional foundations,” he said. “We just need every single person in this country to think about where we are and where we want to be,” he said. “I don’t care what his politics are. I care that he was an American.” Cox said the first of the inalienable rights enshrined in the Declaration of Independence is “life, and today a life was taken. Charlie Kirk was first and foremost a husband and a dad to young children. He was also very much politically involved. And that’s why he was here on campus. Charlie believed in the power of free speech and debate to shape ideas and to persuade people.” President of the university where Kirk was killed calls his death tragic Utah Valley University President Astrid Tuminez posted on X that the school is “shocked and saddened” by Kirk’s death. She expressed her condolences to his family and said they are grieving with the many people from the school who saw the “unspeakable tragedy” unfold. “We firmly believe that UVU is a place to share ideas and to debate openly and respectfully. Any attempt to infringe on those rights has no place here,” the statement said. Kirk backers leave flowers at Turning Point headquarters The flags outside Turning Point USA’s Phoenix headquarters have been lowered to half staff. Bouquets of flowers delivered by well-wishers are piling up by the main door to one of at least three buildings that make up Turning Point’s campus. The organization’s presence has grown steadily in a quiet neighborhood at the base of South Mountain park. Former President George W. Bush says violence must be `purged from the public square’ Bush lamented the killing and said “an open exchange of opposing ideas should be sacrosanct” on a college campus, where Kirk was shot. In his statement, Bush added: “Members of other political parties are not our enemies; they are our fellow citizens.” The Republican ex-president closed the statement by asking God to bless Kirk and his family and “guide America toward civility.” Another former president, Democrat Bill Clinton, wrote on X that he was saddened and angered by the killing, adding he hoped “we all go through some serious introspection” and “redouble our efforts to engage in debate passionately, yet peacefully.” I’m saddened and angered by Charlie Kirk’s murder. And I hope we all go through some serious introspection and redouble our efforts to engage in debate passionately, yet peacefully. Hillary and I are keeping Erika, their two young children, and their family in our prayers. Kirk follower says he went to Turning Point USA’s headquarters to give large donation in person Retiree Alex Lane said news of Kirk’s killing prompted him to head to the organization’s Phoenix headquarters and hand the organization a $10,000 check. “I hope and trust that they’re going to continue with the message that he had,” Lane, 54, told The Associated Press while standing outside the headquarters. Lane said he was a follower of Kirk’s and had given to Turning Point before, but never such a large sum. “It’s a huge loss, there’s no question about it,” Lane said. “But I think the important thing for people to understand is that (Kirk’s message) is going to continue. The assassin didn’t stop it. If anything, I think it will bring more attention to his message.” Lawmakers reflect on Kirk’s influence Multiple Republicans in Congress knew Kirk personally and were devastated by his death. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida spoke on the Capitol steps, reflecting on his influence on her political journey. Luna said she was planning to go to medical school before Kirk recruited her to work as his national Hispanic outreach director. She attended events where Kirk debated students, like the one he hosted today. “That conversation needs to happen,” Luna said. “You can’t squelch that.” Kirk killed with single shot in supposed targeted attack, authorities say Utah Gov. Spencer Cox called the killing a “political assassination.” A “person of interest” was in custody Wednesday evening, Cox said, though no charges were immediately announced. “This is a dark day for our state,” Cox said. “We are actively looking for anyone and everyone who has any information related to the shooting,” he said. Utah authorities said the shooter wore dark clothing and fired from a roof on campus some distance away. RFK Jr., son and nephew of assassinated leaders, laments another loss Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appeared to invoke his family’s losses as he reacted to Kirk’s killing. “Once again, a bullet has silenced the most eloquent truth teller of an era,” Kennedy wrote on social media. He called Kirk a “relentless and courageous crusader for free speech.” Kennedy’s father, for whom he was named, was assassinated in 1968 as he sought the Democratic presidential nomination. The elder Kennedy was an outspoken critic of the Vietnam War before many elected leaders in Washington. He also had been an advocate for civil rights legislation as attorney general during his brother’s presidency and after John F. Kennedy’s assassination in 1963. Person suspected in fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk now in custody, FBI director says The person suspected of fatally shooting conservative activist Charlie Kirk on a Utah college campus Wednesday is now in custody, according to a social media post from FBI Director Kash Patel. The subject for the horrific shooting today that took the life of Charlie Kirk is now in custody. Thank you to the local and state authorities in Utah for your partnership with @fbi . We will provide updates when able. Kirk fans pay their respects at the Turning Point headquarters in Phoenix One man delivered flowers and wiped tears from his face as he left. He said he was too broken up to speak to reporters. On the sidewalk, 14-year-old Samuel Monahan embraced his parents in prayer. “This is what happens when we’re without God,” said Monahan. The teenager said he admired Kirk for being a man of God who cared about people. The country is so polarized, he said, “but it didn’t have to be that way because we all bow our heads under one flag and under one God.” Former President Obama condemns Kirk’s `despicable’ killing “This kind of despicable violence has no place in our democracy,” former President Barack Obama wrote on X. We don’t yet know what motivated the person who shot and killed Charlie Kirk, but this kind of despicable violence has no place in our democracy. Michelle and I will be praying for Charlie’s family tonight, especially his wife Erika and their two young children. He said he and former first lady Michelle Obama will pray for Kirk’s wife and two young children. Chaffetz says he’s angry about Kirk’s death “It makes me mad. I’m so mad that this happened in our backyard. It’s an embarrassment,” the Utah Republican former member of Congress told Fox News Channel. Chaffetz was at the event where Kirk was shot. “We’re better than this, but there’s somebody out there who is evil, absolute total, complete evil and they need to be taken down,” he said. Kirk’s appearance at Utah Valley University marked the kickoff of his national college tour He was calling it “The American Comeback Tour.” And he was featuring his “Prove Me Wrong Table,” where Kirk sat, as he was Wednesday, and fielded questions from students, including those who disagreed with him. He also had appearances slated for Colorado State University, the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, Virginia Tech University, Utah State University, the University of North Dakota, Montana State University, Indiana University Louisiana State University and the University of Mississippi over the next two months. The scene around campus Armed officers are walking around the neighborhood bordering the campus, knocking on doors and asking for information on the shooter. Officers have been seen looking at a photo on their phones and showing it to people to see if they recognize a person of interest. Mayor urges people to report anything suspicious Mayor David Young of the north-central Utah city of Orem says several local, state and federal law enforcement agencies are investigating and that the suspect in Kirk’s shooting remains at large. Young says police in Orem and at Utah Valley University are among many agencies involved in the investigation. Meanwhile, authorities have told anyone at Utah Valley University to ‘secure in place’ after Wednesday’s shooting. The campus was closed, and a post on the school’s emergency information page told those still on campus to call officials to be escorted out. An increase in violence against public officials Kirk’s killing follows instances of political violence in the United States in recent months, including the assassination of a Democratic Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband in June and the fatal shooting of two Israeli Embassy staffers in Washington in May. Though little is known about the shooter or the motive in this case, it can’t be ignored that polarization and normalization of violence have become threaded through U.S. politics, said Kurt Braddock, an assistant professor of public communication at American University. Braddock pointed to data from Princeton University’s Bridging Divides Initiative, which shows that threat and harassment incidents against local officials also have been gradually increasing. “We’re moving in a very dangerous direction, and I think we have been moving in this direction for quite some time,” Braddock said. Charlie Kirk is dead, Trump says Trump says the conservative activist and his close ally died Wednesday after being shot at a college event in Utah. The president posted on Truth Social that the conservative activist and his close ally died Wednesday after being shot at a college event in Utah. “No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie. He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us.” Person arrested is not a suspect, AP source says A person who was taken into custody at Utah Valley University was not the suspect, according to a person familiar with the investigation who was not authorized to speak publicly. It was not clear if authorities were still searching the campus for a suspect. Michelle L. Price Trump says Kirk ‘was a very, very good friend’ In a phone interview with the New York Post, Trump said Kirk is “not doing well” and “it looks very bad.” “He was a very, very good friend of mine and he was a tremendous person,” Trump said. Kirk invite to Dartmouth College campus was in demand: school president Dartmouth College President Sian Beilock says a bipartisan student group invited Kirk to that Ivy League campus for a Sept. 25 event. Beilock says the event “was sold out within 10 minutes.” Beilock made the comment during a media event Wednesday with other college presidents.

Political violence has absolutely no place in our nation.” The horrific shooting today at Utah Valley University is reprehensible. Political violence has absolutely no place in our nation.

Gretchen Whitmer, who was the subject of a kidnapping plot, said on social media that “we should all come together to stand up against any and all forms of political violence.” Two men were imprisoned for their 2020 plot to kidnap the governor during her first term. Thinking of Charlie Kirk, his family, and the community at UVU after the horrific shooting. We should all come together to stand up against any and all forms of political violence. It’s unacceptable. A Republican at the event says he heard one shot A former U.S. representative for Utah’s 3rd congressional district, Jason Chaffetz, says when the shot rang out, Kirk had just been asked a question by someone in the crowd about transgender people and shootings. “As soon as I saw Charlie go back, you realize that it was a shot,” Chaffetz says. “It wasn’t as if there was a whole bunch of gunfire. It was one shot.” Elected officials react to the shooting U.S. Vice-President JD Vance: “Dear God, protect Charlie in his darkest hour.” Dear God, protect Charlie in his darkest hour. pic.twitter.com/RqNYfHLs2b Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg: “Political violence must be always and totally rejected,” Buttigieg wrote on X. “Praying for him and all who may have been injured or impacted.” Horrific to hear that Charlie Kirk was shot today in Utah.

From those beginnings, its enrollment has jumped five-fold over the past three decades. The college is not affiliated or owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, known widely as the Mormon church. Bipartisan rejections of political violence continue Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat and a potential 2028 presidential candidate, called the shooting “chilling & horrific” in an X post.

            "GENEVA: The UN's health agency said Wednesday its workers will remain in Gaza City despite calls from Israel's military for people to flee an assault it is mounting there. “To civilians in Gaza: WHO and partners remain in Gaza City,“ the World Health Organization said on its X account. Israel's army is intensifying its attacks on Gaza City -- the main urban centre in the besieged Gaza Strip -- with the goal of seizing the city. This week, it warned civilians there to leave. The UN estimates that around one million Palestinians live in and around Gaza City. “WHO is appalled by the latest evacuation order,“ the head of the UN agency, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said on X. He said the Israeli demand that the city’s one million people go to what Israel was calling a “humanitarian zone” in the south of the Gaza Strip was unfeasible. “The zone has neither the size nor scale of services to support those already there, let alone new arrivals,“ he said. Tedros pointed out that half of the functioning hospitals left in the Gaza Strip were in Gaza City, and the territory’s “crippled health system cannot afford to lose any of these remaining facilities”. He urged the international community to “act”, saying that, in Gaza, “this catastrophe is human-made, and the responsibility rests with us all”. Israel has been waging offensive operations in Gaza since October 2023, following a deadly attack launched from there by Hamas that resulted in the deaths of 1,219 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 64,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to figures from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza that the United Nations considers reliable.

            "Paris [France], September 11 (ANI): French President Emmanuel Macron met Qatari Prime Minister Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani and strongly condemned the Israeli airstrikes in Doha, Qatar, saying the attacks were \"unacceptable\" and warning against the spread of the Gaza conflict to the broader region on Wednesday. Macron said he conveyed France's position directly to Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani during their meeting.

Sharing the information, Macron wrote on X, \"I met with the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim, following the Israeli strikes yesterday in Doha. I told him: these strikes are unacceptable. I condemn them. I reiterated France's commitment to the sovereignty and security of Qatar.\" He added that negotiations for the release of hostages held by Hamas and talks on a Gaza ceasefire will resume \"without delay.\" Macron also praised Qatar's role in mediation efforts, noting its \"constant efforts toward this end.\" Also Read | Israel Strikes Yemen: PM Benjamin Netanyahu Says 'We Will Continue To Strike' After Tel Aviv Pounds Houthi Targets (Watch Video). https://x.com/EmmanuelMacron/status/1965862421869810175 \"This state of permanent war in Gaza can no longer continue. Two peoples and two states. Peace and security for all,\" Macron said, stressing that France is working with international partners ahead of a conference on the two-state solution scheduled for September 22 in New York. Earlier, Macron had issued a separate statement calling Israel's strikes in Qatar \"unacceptable in any way, shape, or form, whatever the justification may be.\" He expressed support for Qatar and its leader Sheikh Tamim, adding, \"The war cannot and must not spread to other parts of the region.\" This comes after Israel carried out a series of airstrikes on Tuesday targeting Hamas leadership in Doha, marking an unprecedented military action inside the territory of a key US ally and mediator in Gaza ceasefire negotiations, CNN reported. According to CNN, Israel immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, calling it part of an operation codenamed \"Summit of Fire\". According to Hamas, six individuals were killed in the strike, including five of its members. However, the group confirmed that its negotiating delegation survived.Among those killed were the son of Hamas' chief negotiator Khalil Al-Hayya and the director of his office. A Qatari security official also reportedly died in the attack, CNN reported. As per CNN, the strikes hit West Bay Lagoon, a high-end residential district in Doha where, according to Qatar's foreign ministry, members of Hamas' political bureau had been residing. At the time of the strike, Hamas said its representatives were reviewing a US-backed ceasefire proposal. While Al-Hayya was believed to be the main target, he was not among the dead. Following the strike, Qatar's Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly condemned the attack, calling it a \"cowardly\" and \"criminal assault\" that violated international laws and norms. The Ministry stated that the strike posed a serious threat to the safety of Qatari citizens and residents and emphasised that such actions were a blatant violation of Qatar's sovereignty and security. \"The State of Qatar strongly condemns the cowardly Israeli attack that targeted residential buildings housing several members of the Political Bureau of Hamas in the Qatari capital, Doha. This criminal assault constitutes a blatant violation of all international laws and norms and poses a serious threat to the security and safety of Qataris and residents in Qatar,\" spokesperson for Qatar's Ministry of Foreign Affairs Majed Al Ansari said in a post on X. He added that investigations into the incident are underway at the highest level and that further details will be shared once available. Qatar also warned that it \"will not tolerate this reckless Israeli behaviour and the ongoing disruption of regional security.\" \"The Ministry affirms that the security forces, civil defense, and relevant authorities immediately began addressing the incident and taking necessary measures to contain its repercussions and ensure the safety of the residents and surrounding areas. While the State of Qatar strongly condemns this assault, it confirms that it will not tolerate this reckless Israeli behavior and the ongoing disruption of regional security, nor any act that targets its security and sovereignty. Investigations are underway at the highest level, and further details will be announced as soon as they are available,\" he added.

            "The U.S. Department of Interior announced Wednesday it is proposing to rescind a controversial 2024 rule invoked under the Biden administration to put conservation on the same setting as other multi-uses on public lands. While the move was blasted by conservation and environmental groups, it was lauded by the oil and gas industry. “The Conservation and Landscape Health rule upended over a century of public lands management practices that strike a balance between providing the resources our nation needs with protecting the environment,” said Western Energy Alliance President Melissa Simpson. “Whereas lands leased for oil and natural gas development are still available for numerous other uses such as recreation, land that would be set aside for conservation would restrict other productive uses,” she added. The Independent Petroleum Association of America’s chief operating officer and executive vice president Dan Naatz agreed. “ Independent oil and natural gas producers have always opposed this misguided policy pushed by the Biden administration. The rule turned the long-standing policy of ‘multiple use’ of federal lands on its head and was another step toward non-use of public lands. It would have had devastating impacts for towns and communities throughout the Intermountain West and we strongly support Secretary (Doug) Burgum’s actions today.\" A statement released by the Interior Department said the 2024 Public Lands Rule made conservation (i.e., no use) an official use of public lands, putting it on the same level as BLM’s other uses of public lands. The previous administration had treated conservation as “no use,” meaning the land was to be left idle rather than authorizing legitimate uses of the land like grazing, energy development or recreation, the agency said. Additionally, the agency noted that stakeholders (including the energy industry, recreational users and agricultural producers) across the country expressed deep concern that the rule created regulatory uncertainty, reduced access to lands and undermined the long-standing multiple-use mandate of the Bureau of Land Management as established by Congress. A betrayal of public lands? But some environmental groups described the proposed recision as a betrayal of the public lands. The Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance issued this statement: “America’s wildest public lands face unprecedented threats from the Trump administration and its repeated decisions to prioritize fossil fuel development and extractive industry over clean water, wildlife habitat, and wild open spaces. This is especially the case in Utah, where Trump’s policies are having devastating consequences for the nation’s redrock wilderness,” said Steve Bloch, SUWA’s legal director. SUWA did confirm, however, that no conservation leases had been issued under the Biden administration. But the proposed scrapping of the rule, even though it had not been used, brought condemnation. “Trump’s decision to scrap this rule is nothing short of a betrayal of America’s public lands. Our laws are clear that conservation is not optional. It’s a core part of multiple use,” said Randi Spivak, public lands policy director at the Center for Biological Diversity. “For far too long, the Bureau of Land Management has tilted the scales toward drilling, mining and grazing. Gutting the Public Lands Rule will harm wildlife, clean water, and the communities that depend on healthy lands. The Trump administration’s move hands the keys of our shared heritage to extractive industries and tries to lock the rest of us out. But doing so is not lawful,” Spivak said. The Natural Resources Defense Council said the repeal signals the administration’s intent to dismantle commonsense protections and hand public lands over to unchecked industrial development. “Eliminating this rule is a dangerous step backward that puts endangered wildlife, rural communities, and clean drinking water at risk,” said Bobby McNaney, the group’s director of land conservation. “The Bureau of Land Management is supposed to think about more than just mining, timber, and oil and gas development. By moving to dump the Public Lands Rule, it is trying to jettison a critical mechanism that helps to ensure that conservation is on equal footing.” \n",

            "The Corporate Accountability and Public Participation Africa (CAPPA) has commended the Federal Government’s decision to develop a draft policy that will earmark revenues from excise taxes on alcohol, tobacco, and sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) for health financing. It described the initiative as a decisive opportunity for the President Bola Ahmed Tinubu administration to leave a legacy of sustainable funding for Nigeria’s fragile healthcare system and to protect the health of Nigerian citizens. Speaking at a recent national health-financing dialogue in Abuja, Mr. Taiwo Oyedele, Chairman of the Presidential Fiscal Policy and Tax Reforms Committee, disclosed that the Federal Government is finalising a draft policy to channel excise-tax revenues from alcohol, tobacco, and sugary drinks into health financing. According to him, the policy will soon be submitted to the Minister of Health and Social Welfare. Responding to the disclosure in a statement on Monday, CAPPA referenced local and World Health Organisation (WHO) reports showing that Nigeria is reeling from grossly inadequate public health financing and grappling with the double burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), fuelled by the excessive consumption of sugar-laden beverages, salt, tobacco and alcohol by citizens. These diseases, it added, were responsible for nearly 30 per cent of all deaths in the country, making the situation a public health emergency. By initiating the draft policy, the FG has demonstrated commitment towards tackling the upsurge of NCDs in the country, CAPPA said. It urged the government to take comprehensive action, not only by earmarking SIN Taxes but also by adopting the recommendations of the WHO and CAPPA to make the taxes effective. This would involve benchmarking them on rates high enough to reduce consumption, encourage product reformulation, and ultimately ease the country’s health burden. The WHO had recently advised Nigeria and other member states to raise the prices of sugary drinks, alcohol, and tobacco by 50 percent through taxation over the next decade, as a means of curbing NCDs. The organisation expressed confidence that such measures would cut consumption of these harmful products, which contribute to illnesses such as diabetes and cancer, while also generating critical revenue for public health. The call was part of its “3 by 35 Initiative,” a global effort, which, according to the WHO, comes at a time when health systems are under immense strain from rising NCDs, shrinking development aid, and mounting public debt. NCDs, including heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, account for over 75 percent of all deaths worldwide, and, according to the WHO, a one-time 50 percent price increase on these products could prevent 50 million premature deaths over the next 50 years. ALSO READ : Dangote, NUPENG reach agreement, suspend strike Akinbode Oluwafemi, Executive Director of CAPPA, applauded the Tax Reforms Committee’s courage and vision in drafting the policy but cautioned that unless the health taxes are raised to an effective threshold, the policy will not achieve its intended goal. “We commend the government for proposing to earmark the revenues from SIN tax to public health, as long advocated by WHO, CAPPA and other pro-public health civil society organisations in Nigeria. However, we must emphasise that in the case of sugary drinks, the impact of this draft policy will only be maximised if Nigeria significantly raises SSB tax from the current N10 per litre to at least N130 per litre, adjustable to inflation. “CAPPA has consistently recommended, based on available evidence and in-depth research, that the current N10 per litre excise duty—introduced under the 2021 Finance Act—is grossly inadequate. At N10, the tax represents only about N3.33 on a N300, 50cl bottle, less than 1 percent of the retail price. Such a token measure cannot meaningfully discourage excessive consumption or generate substantial revenue,” Oluwafemi stated. \n",

            "LYNN –Former Mayor Patrick McManus built his career on a foundation of education and made sure the city he loved had the same opportunity to grow through knowledge.McManus’s passion for learning started at Lynn English High School, where he served as class president and captain of the football team before graduating in 1972.He went on to earn his bachelor’s degree at Bowdoin College, a master’s in business administration from Suffolk University, and a law degree from Boston College.His career path reflected this dedication: he practiced law, taught at the college level, and in 1985, launched his public service career with election to the City Council.When McManus became Mayor in 1992, that same lifelong love of learning guided his leadership. He championed the Lynn Public Library, directing more than $10 million in city funds toward its programs and operations. But his most memorable contributions were the ones that put books directly into children’s hands.In his first year in office, McManus launched an incentive program that encouraged children to read at least 20 books during the summer months. To celebrate their success, he invited participants to City Hall for an ice cream party, where they were recognized with citations and gifts.“The idea of the incentive program is to promote the importance of reading and reward each individual for hard work and dedication to achieving the goal of reading a total of 20 books,” McManus told The Item in 1995.Chief Librarian Theresa Hurley said such initiatives made a lasting impact. “Studies have shown that children may experience the ‘Summer Slide,’ where children lose knowledge and skills they had during the academic year, particularly for those who have less access to educational opportunities during the summer,” she explained. “It is important to keep kids active, not just physically, but mentally active during the summer months which includes reading, participation in entertaining/educational programs, and peer interaction.”Now, decades later, McManus’ vision for an educated, thriving city will be permanently remembered at the library he championed. A bronze plaque bearing his name will be affixed to the front entrance of the Lynn Public Library, honoring his commitment to the students and families of Lynn.The celebration will begin at 5 p.m., followed by a reception inside the library at 5 North Common St.—a fitting tribute to a mayor who believed that the key to a strong city begins with learning.The post Mayor McManus’ legacy of learning to be memorialized appeared first on Itemlive. \n",

            "LIRE AUSSI De simples habitudes alimentaires peuvent offrir une protection précieuse au cerveau. Déjà reconnu pour réduire le risque de démence, le régime méditerranéen protège particulièrement les personnes les plus vulnérables : celles présentant un risque génétique élevé de développer la maladie d’Alzheimer. Les groupes à haut risque en ont bénéficié davantage La maladie d’Alzheimer comporte une forte composante génétique, avec une transmission héréditaire estimée jusqu’à 80 %. Un gène, l’apolipoprotéine E (APOE), constitue le facteur de risque le plus important. Récemment publiée dans Nature Medicine , l’étude a suivi 4215 femmes et 1490 hommes pendant près de trois décennies. Elle a montré que les personnes porteuses de deux versions de la variante du gène APOE4 — qui multiplie par 12 le risque de maladie d’Alzheimer — connaissaient la plus forte réduction du risque de démence lorsqu’elles adoptaient un mode alimentaire méditerranéen. Au cours de l’étude, ceux qui suivaient un régime de type méditerranéen ont présenté globalement des taux plus faibles de démence et un déclin mental plus lent. Toutefois, l’effet protecteur s’est révélé particulièrement marqué chez les personnes porteuses de deux versions du gène APOE4. Les chercheurs ont étudié le lien entre alimentation, génétique et risque d’Alzheimer en analysant des questionnaires alimentaires, des échantillons de sang et des données génétiques, puis en surveillant les participants au fil du temps pour repérer les signes de démence. Comment le régime méditerranéen soutient la santé cérébrale Les mécanismes reliant alimentation et expression génétique dans la maladie d’Alzheimer ne sont pas encore totalement compris. Les chercheurs soupçonnent toutefois que des facteurs épigénétiques — des modifications de l’activité des gènes influencées par l’environnement, notamment l’alimentation — interviennent dans ce processus. Les auteurs de l’étude estiment qu’une consommation accrue d’aliments typiques du régime méditerranéen augmente les niveaux de graisses saines dans l’organisme, ce qui pourrait soutenir la santé du cerveau. Ce régime favorise aussi une hausse de certains composés naturels, comme la pipérine, la bétaïne et l’acide pantothénique, connus pour protéger les cellules cérébrales. Par ailleurs, il pourrait influencer des substances liées à la dégradation de la caféine, aux propriétés antioxydantes et neuroprotectrices, notamment chez les porteurs du gène APOE4. « Ces résultats suggèrent que des stratégies alimentaires, et en particulier le régime méditerranéen, pourraient contribuer à réduire le risque de déclin cognitif et retarder la démence en agissant globalement sur des voies métaboliques clés », a déclaré dans un communiqué l’auteure principale Yuxi Liu, chercheuse au Brigham and Women’s Hospital (Mass General Brigham). « Cette recommandation s’applique à tous, mais elle pourrait être encore plus cruciale pour les personnes ayant un risque génétique élevé. » Les aliments qui nourrissent le cerveau Le régime méditerranéen met l’accent sur des aliments qui soutiennent la santé neuronale, a expliqué à Epoch Times le Dr Brynna Connor, médecin de famille certifiée et spécialiste en médecine anti-âge et régénérative, non impliquée dans l’étude. Ces aliments comprennent les poissons gras, les légumes à feuilles vertes, les céréales complètes et les fruits rouges. Riches en acides gras oméga-3, les poissons gras apportent d’importants bienfaits pour le cerveau. Ces nutriments essentiels soutiennent les processus cognitifs, protègent contre les maladies neurodégénératives et aident à maintenir la santé cérébrale dans son ensemble. Des recherches ont montré un lien direct entre la consommation d’oméga-3 et un vieillissement cérébral plus lent, ainsi qu’un déclin cognitif réduit. Les personnes qui mangent plus d’aliments riches en oméga-3 présentent souvent une plus grande quantité de matière grise, région clé du cerveau liée à la mémoire, à l’apprentissage et à la prise de décision. « Quand on pense aux poissons gras, on pense souvent au saumon ; mais d’autres options existent : le maquereau, le thon rouge, les sardines, le bar rayé, le hareng, le poisson à chair blanche ou encore les anchois », a précisé le Dr Connor. Selon elle, les noix constituent une autre bonne source d’oméga-3. Des recherches montrent que les personnes qui en consomment régulièrement présentent une mémoire et des fonctions cognitives meilleures que celles qui n’en consomment pas. Les légumes à feuilles vertes du régime méditerranéen contribuent également au maintien des fonctions cérébrales. « Riches en nutriments et en antioxydants bénéfiques pour le cerveau, les légumes à feuilles vertes comme les épinards, le chou frisé ou la roquette jouent un rôle crucial dans la protection des voies neuronales », a déclaré le Dr Connor. Des études menées chez des personnes âgées de 58 à 99 ans ont montré une forte corrélation entre une consommation fréquente de légumes verts et une meilleure santé cognitive. Le cerveau des plus gros consommateurs fonctionne comme celui de personnes plus jeunes d’une dizaine d’années. « Pour maximiser les bénéfices des légumes verts, visez au moins une portion par jour, avec d’autres choix comme les feuilles de chou vert, le bok choy ou les bettes, afin de protéger contre le déclin cognitif lié à l’âge », a ajouté le Dr Connor. Emily Feivor, diététicienne au Northwell Health, également non impliquée dans l’étude, a souligné que la faible teneur en aliments transformés du régime méditerranéen aide à « prévenir l’inflammation associée aux troubles cognitifs ». Pourquoi davantage de recherches sont-elles nécessaires ? « L’une des raisons pour lesquelles nous avons voulu étudier le régime méditerranéen, c’est qu’il s’agit du seul modèle alimentaire qui a été directement associé à des bénéfices cognitifs dans le cadre d’un essai randomisé », a rappelé Mme Liu. L’équipe voulait comprendre si les antécédents génétiques modifiaient ces bénéfices. La recherche a porté sur des personnes instruites, d’ascendance européenne. Les scientifiques insistent sur la nécessité d’étudier des populations plus diverses afin de vérifier que ces résultats s’appliquent à tous. Aujourd’hui, les tests génétiques et sanguins ne sont pas encore utilisés en routine pour évaluer le risque d’Alzheimer, mais cela pourrait changer avec les nouvelles recherches. « Dans nos prochains travaux, nous espérons explorer si le ciblage de certains métabolites par l’alimentation ou d’autres interventions pourrait offrir une approche plus personnalisée pour réduire le risque de démence », a expliqué la chercheuse. Pour l’instant, les mécanismes précis reliant alimentation et expression du gène APOE dans la maladie d’Alzheimer ne sont pas complètement élucidés. Les chercheurs examinent si des facteurs alimentaires influencent l’activité des gènes et comment cela pourrait affecter le risque de maladie. Les facteurs épigénétiques sont considérés comme une piste possible. L’épigénétique fait référence à des modifications de l’activité des gènes qui n’altèrent pas la séquence de l’ADN, mais qui peuvent être façonnées par l’environnement, notamment l’alimentation. Des processus comme la méthylation de l’ADN (changements chimiques qui activent ou désactivent certains gènes) et la modification des histones (protéines qui contrôlent l’activité génétique) pourraient jouer un rôle dans la façon dont des facteurs de risque comme l’APOE contribuent au développement de la maladie d’Alzheimer.

Further probe led to the arrest of Gurjit Singh, a resident of Kotli Saka village. On his identification, police seized 2.06 kg of heroin, a .30 bore pistol, and a magazine. A case has been registered at PS Chheharta, Amritsar, and officials indicated that further arrests and recoveries are expected as the investigation progresses. Earlier, Border Security Force (BSF) apprehended five persons and seized pistols, heroin and a drone on the Punjab border on Sunday, informed the BSF Punjab. In a crackdown against narco-terror, BSF Punjab troops foiled multiple smuggling attempts along the border. Acting on intelligence, BSF & ANTF Amritsar apprehended one smuggler near Chabbal, Tarn Taran, recovering 504 gms of heroin, a mobile & bike. Following that, at Sur Singh Market, Tarn Taran, a joint team detained four smugglers with 5.032 kg heroin, two pistols, a Scorpio, four mobiles, two bikes & Rs 1,000 cash. During night hours, vigilant troops intercepted a drone near Ranian, conducted a search Op and seized a DJI Air 3 drone with pistol parts & magazine. Yet another Operation in Tarn Taran led to the recovery of pistol parts from fields near Wan village. These major apprehensions and seizures highlight BSF's dedicated efforts to safeguard borders and crush Pak-backed narco-terror networks, said BSF Punjab.

            "Rolling across the rugged, rusty red terrain on Mars, NASA’s Perseverance rover came upon some rocks with peculiar green, blue, black and white dots. After detailed image analysis, scientists have come to a potentially encouraging conclusion: If those speckled rocks were formed like they are on Earth, they might be evidence of past life on the dusty planet. The rocks “very well could be the clearest sign of life that we’ve ever found on Mars, which is incredibly exciting,” acting NASA administrator Sean P. Duffy said in a news conference Wednesday. The findings were published in the journal Nature on Wednesday. The rocks, or mudstones, are composed of finely packed sediment and covered in specks resembling poppy seeds and leopard spots. The colorful features, the study found, are minerals that - on Earth - have traditionally been created from microbial activity. Sign up to The Nightly's newsletters.

The research team would need to investigate pieces of the rocks in person to confirm if a Martian microbe was behind the unusual patterns. That’s far easier said than done. But Joel Hurowitz, lead author of the study, called the rocks “probably the most astrobiologically exciting” samples identified by the Perseverance rover since it landed on Mars in 2021. “The sample contains what we believe to be a potential biosignature,” a feature that could have a biological origin, he said. “I don’t think we can say that about any of the other samples that we collected” on the rover’s journey. The rover has been exploring an area known as the Jezero Crater, which scientists say was once a lake bed with aspects that made it conducive to life. The rocks were found inside Neretva Vallis, an ancient river valley that shuttled water to the crater billions of years ago. “The thing I find most exciting about this sample is that it contains features large enough to be seen with the naked eye that could be examined to test for past life,” said Michael Tice, a study co-author and member of the Mars 2020 Perseverance science team searching for signs of life. “That’s surprisingly rare when you are studying evidence for ancient microscopic life.” One idea of how the rocks may have accumulated there, Associate Professor Hurowitz said, is that the river valley may have been temporarily dammed up, perhaps by a landslide. He said the ancient scene may have looked similar to the Mississippi River today, with mud settling to the bottom of turbid brown water. As sediment accumulated, he recounted, the muddy rocks seemed to have brought in iron, phosphorus and sulphur as well as organic matter. The organic matter is exciting in itself, Hurowitz said, because the carbon-based molecules are the building blocks of life. It could have come from a life form long ago, or it could have served as food for other living organisms. Or it could be tied to a nonliving source, such as a meteorite. “We don’t know where that matter came from, but we detect it in the mud,” Assoc-Prof Hurowitz said. “This is really the first compelling signal of organic matter that we’ve had since we landed in Jezero Crater.” But the colorful speckles on the rocks pose an even more alluring mystery. These features are two well-known minerals made of iron, phosphorus and sulfur. One called vivianite - also sometimes referred to as corpse crystals - forms during the decay of organic material and is blue-green. The other, called greigite, shows up as a dull brown. But when these two minerals are found together in sediments on Earth, Hurowitz said, it’s usually a result of microbial metabolisms. “Microbes will eat the organic matter and react it with the mud, and the by-product of that reaction is these minerals,” Assoc-Prof Hurowitz said. “That’s kind of why we’re as excited as we are about this.” The authors acknowledge that these minerals could have formed without microbes - with the involvement of heat, for instance. But the new study determined the Martian rocks don’t appear to have been heated. “The available evidence collected by the rover seems to point more strongly towards the possibility of microbial activity,” Assoc-Prof Hurowitz said. The involvement of microbes is plausible, said Nicolas Dauphas, a planetary scientist who was not involved in the research. But to be more certain would require direct measurements or detailed mineralogical and chemical analyses - and that would mean bringing the samples back to Earth. “These rocks are prime targets in the search for ancient life on Mars,” said Professor Dauphas, from the University of Hong Kong, in an email. “Only (a) Mars sample return can answer the billion-dollar question: ‘Was there ever life on Mars?’” But that journey between the planets is uncertain. Last year, NASA put its Mars Sample Return mission on a bare-bones budget. In January, the agency said it will entertain two potential approaches to grab the samples. One is a previously used “sky crane” technique demonstrated by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and the other would be a less clear option from the commercial sector. NASA is expected to confirm which strategy to pursue in the second half of next year. But President Donald Trump’s fiscal 2026 budget request, if approved by Congress, ends the Mars Sample Return mission - deeming it financially unsustainable. In Wednesday’s news conference, Mr Duffy said the administration is still committed to human exploration and, therefore, scientific research like this. He said the goal is to find better and faster ways to bring back the samples. “What we’re going to do is look at our budgets, we’re going to look at our timing and how do we spend money better and what technology do we have to get samples back more quickly,” Mr Duffy said. “So that’s a current analysis that’s happening right now.” There are ways to remotely learn more about how these speckled rocks were made, Assoc-Prof Hurowitz said. Scientists could try to mimic the Martian conditions in labs on Earth and re-create the processes that formed the minerals, which could help them understand if microbes were required. But the most fruitful - and perhaps the only really definitive - investigation would happen by analyzing the rock directly, the authors agreed. And if the minerals were created by microbes, the search for life on Mars could become a lot more interesting. “If microorganisms once existed on Mars, there is a possibility that their descendants could still be there,” Professor Tice said, “just living in different environments.” \n",

Spencer Cox, though no charges were immediately announced. Utah authorities said the shooter wore dark clothing and fired from a roof on campus some distance away. Kirk's death was announced on social media by Trump, who praised the 31-year-old co-founder and CEO of the youth organization Turning Point USA as “Great, and even Legendary.” Charlie Kirk, who helped build support for Trump among young people, dies after campus shooting Charlie Kirk, who rose from a teenage conservative campus activist to a top podcaster, culture warrior and ally of President Donald Trump, has been shot and killed. The shooting Wednesday occurred during one of his trademark appearances at a college in Utah. His death was announced by Trump in a post on his social media platform. The 31-year-old was a prominent conservative activist who embodied the pugnacious and populist approach to politics under Trump’s Republican Party. In 2012, Kirk launched Turning Point USA to reach out to young conservatives. That organization and its affiliates helped turn out voters to get Trump elected in 2024, focusing on those who felt shut out of politics and rarely cast a ballot. Politicians who have experienced violence directly react to Charlie Kirk shooting WASHINGTON (AP) — The fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at an event in Utah had particular resonance for public figures who have experienced political violence themselves. Kirk, who served as chief executive and cofounder of the youth organization Turning Point USA, made frequent appearances on college campuses and in other settings, engaging in political dialogue with students and others. Leaders who have survived public attacks or had family members victimized joined in bipartisan condemnation of the attack on Kirk.

Videos posted to social media show Kirk speaking into a handheld microphone while sitting under a white tent emblazoned with the slogans, “The American Comeback” and “Prove Me Wrong.” A single shot rings out and Kirk reaches for his neck. A large volume of blood gushes from the left side of his neck. The shooting has quickly drawn reaction from leading political figures, including some victims of political violence. 3 teens wounded in shooting at suburban Denver high school, including suspected shooter DENVER (AP) — Authorities say three teens were wounded Wednesday after one of them opened fire with a handgun at a high school in the foothills of suburban Denver. It is not clear what led up to the shooting at Evergreen High School or how the suspected shooter, believed to be a student at the school, was shot. However, a spokesperson for the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office said none of the law enforcement officers who responded to the shooting fired any shots. All three teens were originally listed in critical condition. But by early evening, one teen was in stable condition with non-life threatening injuries. South Korea says a charter plane carrying South Korean workers will leave Atlanta at Thursday noon SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea said that a charter plane carrying South Korean workers will leave Atlanta, Georgia at Thursday noon. South Korea’s Foreign Ministry made the announcement but gave no further details. Airport officials at Atlanta earlier said the return flight with the workers on board planned for Wednesday had been canceled. A total of 475 workers, more than 300 of them South Koreans, were rounded up in the Sept. 4 raid at the battery factory under construction at Hyundai’s sprawling auto plant.

Previous charges, delayed mental health evaluation were missed opportunities in Charlotte stabbing After Decarlos Brown Jr. was arrested for the fatal stabbing of a Ukrainian refugee aboard a North Carolina commuter train, he was quickly sent to a state mental hospital for an evaluation. That's a sharp contrast from a January arrest, where it took more than six months for a court to order a mental evaluation after Brown told officers that he had been given a human-made substance that controlled him. The January arrest was just one of the missed opportunities in Brown’s criminal history, according to experts. He had cycled through the criminal justice system for more than a decade.

A NATO spokesman said it was the first time the alliance confronted a potential threat in its airspace. The incursion happened late Tuesday and into the early hours of Wednesday during a wave of strikes by the Kremlin on Ukraine. The NATO response swiftly raised fears that the war could spill over — a fear that has been growing in Europe as Russia steps up its attacks and peace efforts go nowhere. Israeli airstrikes on Yemen kill at least 35, Houthi officials say DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Yemen's Houthi rebels say Israeli airstrikes targeting the rebels in Yeman have killed at least 35 people and wounded over 130 others. Most of those killed in the strikes Wednesday were in Sanaa, the capital, where a military headquarters and a fuel station were among the sites hit, the health ministry said. Israel’s military carried out the strikes just days after Houthi rebels launched a drone attack that struck an Israeli airport. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, meanwhile, plans to seek sanctions and a partial trade suspension against Israel over the war in the Gaza Strip. The move adds to Israel’s already unprecedented global isolation as it grapples with the fallout from its strike targeting Hamas leaders in U.S.-allied Qatar on Tuesday. Over 40% of arrests in Trump's DC law enforcement surge relate to immigration, AP analysis finds WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has portrayed his federal law enforcement surge in Washington as a crime-fighting effort. However, data analyzed by The Associated Press shows that over 40% of the arrests during the operation were immigration-related. This highlights the administration’s continued focus on its hardline immigration agenda. The operation led to more than 2,300 arrests, including homicide suspects and gang members. More than 940 were immigration-related. The prominence of immigration arrests has fueled criticism that the true purpose was to expand deportations. Critics argue the effort appears more like a model for federal intervention in cities led by Democratic mayors. The administration argues that deportations are inseparable from crime reduction. \n",

            "Nuevos equipos comunitarios que amplían el acceso de las doulas y fortalecen la atención materna en todo el país ARLINGTON, Virginia , 10 de septiembre de 2025 /PRNewswire-HISPANIC PR WIRE/ -- March of Dimes, la organización líder que lucha por la salud de todas las madres y bebés, y CVS Health Foundation anunciaron hoy la segunda cohorte del Equitable Access to Doula Care Project, que trabaja para ampliar el conocimiento y el acceso a los servicios de la doula mientras crece y apoya a la fuerza laboral de la doula. Hoy en día, en EE. UU., millones de mujeres carecen de acceso a atención de maternidad de calidad durante y después del embarazo, lo que aumenta el riesgo de complicaciones tanto para la madre como para el bebé. Un estudio reciente de March of Dimes/Harris Poll reveló que, si bien la mayoría de los estadounidenses están familiarizados con proveedores como obstetras, ginecólogos y parteras, casi la mitad nunca ha oído hablar de una doula. Las doulas son profesionales capacitados que mejoran la atención clínica que reciben las pacientes embarazadas al brindar apoyo físico, emocional y educativo durante todo el proceso del embarazo. Los estudios demuestran que las doulas pueden reducir las complicaciones, disminuir el estrés e incluso aumentar las tasas de lactancia materna, todo lo cual contribuye a mejorar los resultados de salud. \"Nos enorgullece continuar esta colaboración con CVS Health para que más familias puedan acceder a la atención y el apoyo que merecen\", dijo Cindy Rahman , presidenta y directora ejecutiva de March of Dimes. \"Toda persona que da a luz debe sentirse vista, escuchada y apoyada a lo largo de su embarazo, y eso es exactamente lo que proporcionan las doulas. Su presencia ayuda a crear una experiencia de embarazo más respetuosa y positiva y conduce a mejores resultados para las madres y los bebés \". A través de esta colaboración de $ 4 millones y cinco años, las dos organizaciones están trabajando para elevar el papel de las doulas, diversificar la fuerza laboral y equipar a las familias y los proveedores de atención médica con recursos confiables que demuestren el papel que desempeñan las doulas en la mejora de los resultados para las madres y los bebés. El Proyecto de Acceso Equitativo a la Atención de la Doula involucra a dos cohortes de equipos basados en la comunidad, cada uno de los cuales participa en una colaboración gradual de 30 meses para expandir el acceso a la atención de la doula basada en la comunidad. Estos equipos, cada uno dirigido por organizaciones comunitarias y un hospital de atención de maternidad colaborador, forman parte de la Comunidad de Aprendizaje Activo de la Doula de March of Dimes. La segunda cohorte tiene como objetivo aumentar el acceso a la atención de doulas en cuatro comunidades locales de todo el país, que incluyen: East Orange, NJ – La Iniciativa de Equidad en la Salud Perinatal es una organización destinada a eliminar las desigualdades en la salud materna e infantil de las personas negras a través de la promoción, la educación, la participación de la comunidad, la investigación, la colaboración y el apoyo clínico.

            "D2C brands are increasingly leaning on quick commerce platforms from traditional digital channels to leverage the high-intent, impulse-driven consumer base for precision marketing Blinkit, Instamart and Zepto offer 1.5–2 times higher ROAS, compared to Meta and Google, with sales conversions of 3-8% versus 1.5-3% on traditional platforms The quick commerce trio saw their ad revenues soar to INR 3,000–3,500 Cr collectively, however, rising ad rates and competition for visibility pose challenges for smaller D2C brands Every time you look to source your daily consumables from a quick commerce platform, you are offered a host of choices – some are cheaper, while others throw up lucrative combos – and you often end up trying out one of those options, instead of your regular brand. You are tempted yet again by combo offers and attractive products at affordable rates as you move to check out. The result: You top up your cart with stuff that was not even on your mind when you had logged in. If brands can be woven into film scripts, then why can’t they be whisked into the quick commerce marketplaces? Impulse is the name of the game, after all. This subtle form of marketing or advertising goes beyond the usual route of sponsored ads, banners and videos that are listed on these apps. D2C brands and legacy companies rushed in when they spotted the opportunity in quick commerce, going slow on conventional digital media channels like Google and Meta. Quick commerce platforms like Instamart, Blinkit and Zepto responded immediately, thrashing out a suite of advertising packages ranging from INR 2-9 lakh for three months to increase visibility for the advertisers, according to media reports. The strategy is to let a brand onboard various SKUs on a quick commerce platform under a package. The payment is adjusted with the advertisements run for a fixed tenure. Industry stakeholders believe these apps, known for their fast delivery format, have turned into hotspots for targeted advertising, capitalising on a massive captive audience primed for purchases. This growing trend has in fact positioned quick commerce as a formidable competitor to traditional digital advertising giants like Meta (Facebook and Instagram) and Google, where escalating cost-per-click (CPC) rates are prompting brands to seek more efficient alternatives. The number of people scrolling through quick commerce platforms for their daily supplies of groceries, snacks, and essentials is expected to reach 65 Mn by 2030. For D2C brands and advertisers, this throws up a huge opportunity to boost precision marketing. The brands follow a natural course along the quick commerce turf to target the consumer segments where clicks and purchases are more likely compared to that in generic digital platforms. “I think Amazon showed the way when it comes to marketing on ecommerce platforms and they now have a robust advertising business in India. Quick commerce platforms followed naturally. Here, brands can harness first-party data in a closed-loop system to deliver more relevant options, averting a broader coverage in digital advertising,” said GV Krishnamurthy, founder of digital marketing firm AiNxtGen. “While general digital ads might annoy or miss the mark, advertising on quick commerce platforms thrive by focussing on high-intent shoppers in retail environments, achieving incremental ROI over traditional methods.” The INR 1.4-1.6 Lakh Cr advertising market is surging at 10-15% a year, with digital advertising making up 50–60% of this kitty. This share is likely to reach INR 1.5-1.7 Lakh Cr by 2029 , with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands emerging as key drivers. The advent of quick commerce has, in fact, triggered a change in consumer mindset over the past few years. And, D2C brands have zoomed in on the business by allocating 60-70% of their total marketing budget. “Unlike traditional ecommerce, where discovery can be passive, quick commerce consumers are in a buying mindset and they want it now. That makes them a fertile ground for brand experiments,” Mira Jhala, whose Frogo enables quick commerce for brands, said. She noted that these platforms are aggressively promoting their ad solutions, often subsidising trials to encourage brands to dive in. For India’s D2C space that’s likely to scale $300 Bn in value by 2030, this has sparked a rush to campaign on Zepto, Instamart, and Blinkit, especially as the festive season unfolds. Advertising on quick commerce platforms is far more performance-driven than traditional media, according to Prateek Rastogi, who cofounded healthy atta and rice brand Better Nutrition. Unlike TV or print, where impact is measured in reach and impressions, quick commerce ads convert directly into sales at the point-of-intent. What’s driving high-impulse-driven brands from FMCG, beauty and personal care, wellness and home décor park 60-70% of their marketing budget in quick commerce channels? “For FMCG staples and daily-use products, the cost per acquisition is often lower than generic digital channels because the consumer is in a ‘buying mindset’. Every rupee spent on in-app visibility, banner placements, sponsored listings, or sampling, translates to measurable sales impact,” Rastogi said. Besides targeted reach, cost-efficiency and better returns on advertising spends (ROAS) figure high on a brand’s priority list while looking to market products on quick commerce platforms. “While the absolute ad rates can be higher than Facebook or Google, the ROAS is significantly stronger in quick commerce because of instant cart conversions.” Advertising on quick commerce has seen a 3-8% conversions for D2C brands, whereas Amazon and Flipkart, where the brands invest the rest of their ad budget, deliver a 5-8% return on ad spend. For Google and Meta, it was reported at mere 1.5-3%, according to Datum Intelligence. Industry sources said that the ROAS on quick commerce platforms was 2-3 times that of Meta, Google. As brands tend to benefit more, quick commerce platforms have started upping the ante to squeeze out the maximum from the D2C brands. The founders dubbed this as an imminent challenge. “They do offer cheaper alternatives to conventional digital advertising tools. But, the rates are also increasing from the last two years when the user base multiplied. This especially holds true for the festive season when the ad rates jump at least 40-50% and soon may become unaffordable to small and new D2C brands,” alerted the founder of a Bengaluru-based athleisure brand which has its products listed on Instamart and Zepto. There’s a flip side, too. The boom in quick commerce blitz comes with a set of riders. “Mere listing on quick commerce platforms isn’t enough, especially when your top SKUs too are listed there. You can’t really be assured of better returns, even as the platforms convince us to spend money on advertisements to expect better ROAS and eventually sales conversions,” he added. According to Jhala, the performance of any brand marketing depends also on the life cycle of the product. “In the initial burst, ROAS is better than Meta or Google. We have seen campaigns on quick commerce delivering 1.5–2 times higher ROAS for the first few weeks. But, the caveat is that it normalises quickly. Once the ‘newness’ fades and competition for keywords within the app rises, it’s no longer cheaper. The sustainable ROAS still depends on the product-platform fit.” The quick commerce boom in India is on course to create a $30-40 Bn opportunity in the next three to five years. And, as the turf simmers, a three-way race to control the nearly-$7 Bn quick economy turns frenetic. The Qcom Big Three – Eternal-run Blinkit, Swiggy’s Instamart and Zepto – have seen their ad revenues zoom in recent years, driven by high-margin sponsored listings, targeted promotions, and brand partnerships. The result is a sizzling 280% surge in sales over the last two years with a topline of $1 Bn in FY24 alone. The growing advertisement ecosystem will cushion the trio against high cash burns on operational expenses. Ad revenues started from modest bases in the early years but have exploded as the platforms scaled their user base and ad tools. The annual recurring revenue (ARR) from ads across is reportedly estimated at INR 3,000–3,500 Cr for the three platforms put together. Zepto CEO Aadit Palicha had earlier said that its advertisement vertical’s ARR surged five-fold over the past year to INR 1,670 Cr ($200 Mn). Blinkit, which has a 45% share of the quick commerce pie, surpassed INR 400 Cr ad revenue in FY24 and reportedly reached INR 1,000 Cr last year. Although Instamart keeps its breakdowns less detailed, it told the shareholders in Q4 FY25 earnings call that the contribution margin has improved significantly. Like Zepto, Instamart and Blinkit, the D2C brands too are eyeing the wallet share of urban, time-pressed households looking for speed and convenience. This user segment covers millions in count, from young professionals who value instant delivery over traditional grocery shopping to health-conscious consumers in metros and Tier-I cities who want to try new, premium, or functional food products, and impulse buyers who make last-minute decisions, often adding trending or promoted products to their basket. The challenge, Rastogi said, remains in garnering visibility in an increasingly crowded marketplace. With thousands of SKUs fighting for limited screen space, smaller brands are at risk of being overshadowed by established FMCG giants with deeper ad budgets, he added. High dependence on platform algorithms is another challenge for the D2C brands because the discovery of a product often depends on search ranking and sponsored visibility. Moreover, quick commerce offers very little space for storytelling, unlike social media. The D2C brands need to create the narrative so smart that only a thumbnail and a few lines do the job. “I think the next phase of quick commerce advertising won’t be about cheap reach but about precise targeting. Whoever cracks the creative and presents a contextual relevance in a 10-second decision window will have an upper hand,” Jhala said. This means D2C brands must innovate with hyper-personalised ads – perhaps AI-driven recommendations based on past orders – to stand out. Smaller brands are battling growing pressure on their margins from high ad rates, yet, quick commerce unveils a compelling edge over traditional digital routes in the run-up to the festive days. It blends immediacy with precision to drive sales, converting speed into lasting loyalty. \n",

            "PETALING JAYA : The government has approved the full separation of the roles of attorney general (AG) and public prosecutor – a landmark institutional reform aimed at strengthening governance and public confidence in Malaysia’s justice system. The decision follows a review of the Final Report and Roadmap prepared by a Special Task Force on Comparative Study, chaired by Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Law and Institutional Reform) Datuk Seri Azalina Othman Said. Under the plan, both offices will be created independently and placed on equal footing in the Federal Constitution. Amendments to Articles 145, 183 and 42 of the Constitution will establish the public prosecutor as an autonomous authority. A Prosecutor Reform Bill will also be drafted to amend the Criminal Procedure Code and 18 other laws, alongside a new Act to govern remuneration for both the attorney general and public prosecutor, similar to the Judges’ Remuneration Act 1971. Implementation will be phased, with changes to current structures and procedures. A special technical task force, led by the Legal Affairs Division of the Prime Minister’s Department with input from the Attorney-General’s Chambers, Finance Ministry, Public Service Department and other commissions, will detail the organisational, staffing, logistical and financial requirements. Its recommendations will go to the Cabinet before rollout. The government described the move as a “historic step” in reforming Malaysia’s legal institutions, strengthening the rule of law and boosting public trust. Communications Minister and government spokesman Datuk Fahmi Fadzil said the Cabinet reached its decision after Azalina presented several models of separation. “After thorough consideration, the Cabinet agreed to a full separation, whereby both positions will exist independently and equally under the Constitution,” he said at a press conference after the weekly Cabinet meeting yesterday. Fahmi also announced that the Anti-Bullying Tribunal roadshow kicks off today in Putrajaya. “In this programme, Datuk Seri Azalina, as chairperson of the special committee on bullying, will lead the sessions. I will attend as well, alongside Education Minister Fadhlina Sidek. “Four more sessions will follow in Negeri Sembilan, Selangor, Johor and Malacca. Participants will include NUTP (National Union of the Teaching Profession), teachers, parent-teacher association representatives, the Children’s Commission, government agencies, legal practitioners and school counsellors. The sessions will be open to the public,” he said. \n",

            "Raipur (Chhattisgarh) [India], September 11 (ANI): Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Vishnu Dev Sai chaired a meeting of the Central Region Tribal Development Authority at the Korba Collectorate on Wednesday and assured that the government is taking all concrete measures for the welfare and holistic development of tribal communities, and that there would be no shortage of resources for development works. Announcing a major step, CM Sai declared that the budget of the Authority has been increased from Rs 50 crore to Rs 75 crore for the better development of Scheduled Tribe communities residing in the Central Region, said the press release.

CM said that the Chhattisgarh government has taken a strong step towards inclusive development by forming the Bastar, Surguja and Central Region Tribal Development Authorities, along with the Scheduled Caste Development Authority and the Chhattisgarh State Rural and Other Backwards Classes Development Authority. He said that the primary aim of these bodies is to accelerate development works in tribal areas, ensure transparency, and deliver public services to every village and every family.

Pointing out lapses of the previous government, Sai said that lack of accountability and transparency had marred the functioning of these authorities. Many schemes failed to reach the ground due to poor monitoring. To change this situation, the present government has restructured the authorities. Membership has been broadened to include Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha MPs from the region, district panchayat chairpersons and other important public representatives. Additionally, two social workers and experts working in the field of tribal development have been nominated as members so that their experience and expertise can benefit development planning. Chief Minister further said that special focus is being given to education, healthcare and livelihood schemes for tribal communities. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Dharti Aba Tribal Village Utkarsh Abhiyan and PM Janman Yojana have opened up new avenues of development in tribal areas of Chhattisgarh. These initiatives are rapidly strengthening infrastructure such as housing, roads, electricity, drinking water and digital connectivity. He added that women's empowerment in the Central Region was a key priority. Self-Help Groups are being further strengthened with skill training, credit facilities and market linkages, enabling women to become self-reliant. For the youth of the region, technical and vocational training will be provided to prepare them for both employment and self-employment opportunities. Apart from this, Deputy Chief Minister Vijay Sharma said that Chhattisgarh's tribal culture is rich and must be preserved. He emphasised that the Authority will play a key role in ensuring nutrition, health and education for children of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs). He suggested setting up de-addiction centres to inspire tribal communities to give up alcohol, promoting early education and sports, and ensuring permanent pump connections for irrigation in the farms of PVTG farmers. Deputy Chief Minister Arun Sao remarked that the Chief Minister himself, as Chairman of the Central Region Tribal Development Authority, had come to Korba along with the entire government to hold this meeting. Notably, such a meeting was last held on November 30, 2019. Holding it in a Scheduled Area demonstrates the CM's commitment. CM Sai also announced several major initiatives to nurture the talents of tribal children and youth. He sanctioned Rs 10 crore each for the construction and operation of boys' and girls' sports complexes in Korba. Similarly, Rs 10 crore each was sanctioned for two more sports complexes dedicated to PVTG players. He also announced Rs 5 crore for the establishment of a residential school for PVTG students. To streamline traffic movement in Korba city, Chief Minister Sai announced Rs 9 crore for the construction of the Sunalia Bridge. He instructed Forest Department officials to expedite work on the Buka-Satrenga tourism project and directed them to submit a report within two months. On irrigation, CM Sai informed that Rs 2,800 crore has been sanctioned to complete 115 pending irrigation projects that had been left incomplete prior to 2015. Once completed, these projects will provide irrigation facilities to about 76,000 hectares of land.

            "Professor Genevieve Bell, the embattled head of Australian National University, is widely expected to announce her resignation on Thursday morning after a year of turmoil that has fractured the institution and resulted in more than 300 people departing the campus.Chancellor Julie Bishop met with members of the National Tertiary Education Union on Thursday morning ahead of Bell’s resignation being made public.“We discussed our concerns over leadership and governance and the need for no more forced redundancies,” said ACT division secretary of the National Tertiary Education Union.Bishop confirmed at that meeting that provost Rebekah Brown will be appointed as acting vice chancellor.In June, independent ACT Senator David Pocock told a public meeting at ANU that Bell, her executive team and the council, led by former foreign minister Bishop had “trashed an amazing institution”.Intense pressure has been increasing in recent weeks after the national higher education regulator, the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency, appointed former Public Service Commissioner Lynelle Briggs to investigate leadership and governance at ANU.Briggs was given almost unlimited powers to unearth the truth behind a litany of missteps by the university’s most senior leaders.The heat on Bell has been building over the past few months but hit a frenzy last week after it emerged five of the six college deans had delivered an ultimatum to the council that either Bell went, or they would, a person who has seen the letter but asked not to be identified told The Australian Financial Review.On Wednesday, a group of academics met with Bishop to deliver the ANU Governance Project report, which found that 96 per cent of the 700 respondents believed the university’s governance was not fit for purpose and should be reformed, including 52 per cent who said it required a complete overhaul.More than 90 per cent said there was a lack of transparency around ANU governance and how leadership operated.Among the issues highlighted by respondents was that the executive operated without checks and balances, including opaque leadership appointments, rapid growth in senior executive roles, and excessive remuneration which was out of step with community expectations.More to come \n",

            "The terminology you use may vary, but the thing we are talking about is the same. The terminology you use may vary, but the thing we are talking about is the same. Renewed, refurbished, pre-owned, these are smartphones that aren’t new (but they also aren’t the traditional as in ‘second hand’ or ‘used’ phones), but with an assurance that anything that needed to be has been fixed afresh, tend to deliver a lot more value and that climb up the aspirational ladder for many buyers. India’s premium renewed smartphone platform ControlZ has launched its first experience store in Gurugram, in a marked step away from the online-first and e-commerce primed approach that renewed smartphones mostly leaned on. Circling back to the fresh fixes that I touched upon earlier, ControlZ confirms every smartphone they sell undergoes more than 311 stringent quality checks and OEM-grade replacements for displays, cameras, and components. A lot of this is difficult to showcase in an online store, and the physical store should help overcome those challenges for the buyer and the seller. I asked Yug Bhatia, Founder and CEO of ControlZ, why now and how it makes things easier for consumers, and he insists this is the right time to bring that experience offline. “Consumers today care about both value and sustainability, but they also want trust. Our new store makes it easy: people can walk in, see and feel the quality for themselves, and leave with a device that’s like new—100% battery health, 18 months warranty, and zero compromise. It’s about giving people the confidence to choose renewed without a second thought,” he says. The other point of discussion revolved around consumer preferences, and how that underlines the renewed smartphone market outlook. Bhatia insists India’s renewed smartphone market is just beginning to take shape. “We believe it’s going to grow rapidly in the year ahead. Consumers are moving away from second-hand bargains and toward renewed devices that deliver quality, reliability, and peace of mind. That shift is setting new standards for the entire industry,” he says. For Bhatia, ControlZ is never about following this change, but leading it by redefining what renewed means for buyers in India. Competition in this space is increasing, and it’ll be interesting to see in a few months time, how this store has worked out for ControlZ in terms of traction. KEYNOTE MOMENTS As it is every year, Apple’s hardware keynote in 2025 too was extensive. A lot to unpack, which I did on Hindustan Times in the hours after. There’s still some unpacking to do in our weekly conversation. I’ve been speaking with analysts about their take on the announcements Apple made, as they try to make sense of it all. Are you ready? Must start with the iPhone Air, the most exciting new product announced. This is 5.6mm thick (the thinnest iPhone ever), with a 6.5-inch ProMotion display and the same A19 Pro chip that also powers the iPhone 17 Pro phones. It is a sign of the times, as Apple has to compete with the likes of Samsung’s Galaxy 25 Edge, which is 5.8mm thick. What you must ask are a series of questions. Is the iPhone Air a precursor to a foldable iPhone that’s expected next year? Is the iPhone Air a first look at the future of iPhones and not just as a separate ‘Air’ line? Is the Fusion Camera indeed a viable alternative to the versatility of a three-camera system that flagship phones have? “The iPhone 17 Air delivers notable design innovation, likely driving upgrades from loyalists of older models, including iPhone 12 through 15, while the iPhone 17 Pro lineup—with its durable, performance-focused design, enhanced battery, and advanced camera capabilities—will appeal to power users and digital natives alike. The emphasis on improved durability, including drop and scratch resistance, aligns with the growing consumer demand for longer-lasting devices,” summarises Prabhu Ram, Vice President - Industry Research Group, at CyberMedia Research (CMR). Changes on the iPhone 17 Pro line begin with the design, including a new unibody architecture, the switch to a proprietary aluminium material, the use of a Ceramic Shield instead of glass at the back to make it more scratch resistant, and of course, the brightest colour we’ve ever seen on a Pro series iPhone till now. Cosmic Orange, as it is called, will likely be the best-seller for Apple at least in initial months, because it is a step away from the traditionally serious, darker colour shades that the iPhone Pro line has always delivered. That continues to the cameras, including longer optical zoom and a larger primary sensor. The standard iPhone 17 gets a larger 6.3-inch screen size (instead of 6.1-inch) while adding an adaptive refresh rate ProMotion tech and new camera hardware including versatile selfie orientation. This runs the A19 chip, a 3-nanometer architecture chip, with a promise of better battery stamina, up to 20% faster than an iPhone 16, and a faster neural engine for artificial intelligence (AI) processing. Prices of the iPhone 17 start ₹ 82,900 with 256GB being the minimum storage spec. The iPhone 16 prices at launch, ₹ 79,900 onwards. “On the pricing front Apple has this time retained the price points except in few indicating they are expecting a flattish growth globally. Despite rupee weakening against dollar by around 5% in 2025 over 2024 they haven't made major price jumps in India,” notes Faisal Kawoosa, Chief Analyst and co-founder of Techarc. Wearables have really stepped up in terms of capabilities. The third generation AirPods Pro true wireless earbuds, features a custom advanced computational audio and custom audio drivers. Apple says the noise cancellation is optimised to be four times more effective than a previous generation, and that transparency mode is now marked by more human-like ambient voices filtering through to the ear. In our quick experience after the keynote, they aren’t wrong with their claims, with both functionalities significantly better than an earlier generation. The Apple Watch 11 gets improved cellular coverage underlined by improved hardware, heart health tracking including hypertension detection, and a up to 24 hours battery life. Alongside, the Apple Watch SE, the entry point to Apple’s Watch portfolio, gets new functionality such as sleep apnea and sleep score data, as well as 18-hour battery life with addition of fast charging. Our extensive coverage of the keynote... PASSAGE OF TIME Finally, Instagram for iPad. A 15-year wait (another thing the world’s got before GTA VI) leads us to an app that isn’t simply a stretched version of the iPhone app, so much so that this specific tablet interface will soon find space in the Instagram app for Android tablets too. “When designing Instagram for iPad, we wanted to take advantage of the bigger screen to give people more features with fewer taps, while keeping it simple,” the official statement says. Do try this out, for the iPad is often called the ultimate ‘media consumption device’ and Instagram Reels are prime content consumption in this era, and I’d love to hear your thoughts. VISION In a column recently (we didn’t get a chance to talk about this), write about the warning signs that India's telecom market is teetering on the edge of becoming a duopoly dominated by Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel, as Vodafone Idea (Vi) struggles to survive. There is an urgent need to preserve Vodafone Idea (Vi) as a significant telecom player in India. Losing Vi would erode competition—hurt price affordability, service quality, and innovation for billions of mobile users. We have seen it at multiple points in time in the past year — monthly telecom bills and recharge prices have gone up, popular affordable plans have been removed by Airtel and Jio, whilst no discernible real-world network quality improvements (do tell me if your calls no longer drop or you have full network coverage in your apartment elevator or office basement parking). I make the argument that supporting Vi isn't about corporate protectionism but a consumer welfare imperative, in the sense that diminished consumer choice, higher prices, and slowed technological advancement may be the result of a duopoly. There is a need for a clear policy intervention, if at all it is possible—like easing spectrum payment terms, restructuring debt, or other support—to help Vi stabilise and potentially regain competitiveness. Moreover, absence of incentives for new players to enter the market poses a thoughtful question — if we can’t nurture the next ‘Jio,’ alongside the current Jio, how will India stay competitive with upcoming technologies like 6G? KNOW Google will not have to sell its Chrome browser business, to address the search monopoly issue, the judge in the antitrust case has ruled. That should, for starters, put an end to all sorts of naivety where certain AI bros thought they could buy out Chrome from Google, two institutions in their own right. The judge has ruled that Google can continue to pay partners for preloading or placement of its Search or AI products, but the tech giants must share some search information with rivals and bar it from putting together any exclusive deals to distribute its Search or AI assistant products in ways that might cut off distribution for rivals. Google does contend that this guideline to share some data with rivals will impact user data privacy, and that they are looking closely at this. Big picture — this may well be the biggest signal that regulators and courts may not be as willing to break up tech giants, as many expected. OpenAI is adding a layer of parental controls to ChatGPT, which would give parents the option to link their personal ChatGPT account with the accounts of their teenage children. From then on, parents will be able to decide how ChatGPT responds to queries by their kids, as well as disable select features, including memory and chat history. Building on the emotional support aspect that OpenAI has detailed recently, the chatbot will generate automated alerts when it detects a teen in conversation, with “signs of acute distress”.

            "New Delhi: According to Bisleri, India consumes 13 million tonnes of plastic every year, out of which 60% is recycled. The remaining 40% of plastic mostly contains non-recyclable items like wrappers, plastic bags, milk pouches and multilayer chips packets. To reduce the amount of plastic that ends up in landfills and water bodies, and at the same time promote sustainability, packaged water company Bisleri International under its sustainability initiative has introduced a program “Bottles for Change” initiative, which includes a mobile app to connect citizens, plastic collection agents, and recyclers to promote plastic recycling in India. Under the initiative, it collected and recycled over 19,300 tonnes of plastics, K. Ganesh, director - sustainability & corporate affairs at Bisleri International, said at the Mint Sustainability Summit 2025. “The plastic once used should be disposed and sent for recycling,” said Ganesh, pointing to the fact that this doesn't happen because people mostly litter plastic after consumption, which then goes to the landfill or oceans. Promoting circular economy “Our plastic waste management program educates and empowers citizens to practise source segregation, responsible disposal of post-consumer plastic, and to ensure all used plastic is sent for recycling to promote a circular economy, thus eliminating plastics from landfills and reaching our oceans,” Ganesh said. The company also has an app for the initiative, through which “we collect used plastics from registered stakeholders and channel them to recycling facilities, where bottles are transformed into new products and even reborn as bottles again. Multilayer plastics are repurposed into durable plastic sheets, ensuring every piece finds a second life”, said Ganesh. According to Ganesh, all PET (polyethylene terephthalate) bottles being used by Bisleri or other beverage companies can be recycled and converted into fibre yarn, which can be used to make fabric and dress materials. PET bottles can also be recycled to manufacture rPET (recycled PET), which is used to make bottles for food grade packaging applications, by causing less strain on natural resources. The government regulations for extended producer responsibility (EPR) require producers, importers, and brand owners to manage the post-consumer waste of their products. In India, this is mandated under rules like the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016, and involves mandatory registration, submitting EPR action plans, achieving annual recycling targets, and reporting on their efforts. The goal is to promote a circular economy, reduce waste, and ensure environmentally responsible disposal of products like plastic packaging, e-waste, and batteries. Bisleri also collected bottle caps and made benches of them. “The benches are made with 60 kgs of only our caps. We haven't used any pigments or any colour. Through this we are collecting all our caps, which has been used in our manufacturing facilities,” Ganesh added. \n",

            "In today’s world shaped by Google and AI, teachers remain irreplaceable. Why? Because search engines can hand us endless answers, but only a teacher can kindle the curiosity to ask the right questions. While algorithms may process data, it is teachers who invoke empathy, imagination, and the courage to think differently, and so their relevance is not measured by the information they carry, but by the wisdom, patience, and human touch with which they shape lives.Recognising this and honouring educators year after year, the Government of India confers the National Award to Teachers, bestowed annually since 1958. The Department of Higher Education, Ministry of Education, selected 21 teachers in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and Polytechnic this year. Among the recipients was Professor Iyer Vijayalaxmi Kasinath, a Chennaiite who teaches in the School of Planning and Architecture, Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh. From admitting she stumbled into architecture before falling in love with it, to playing a vital part in shaping climate-resilient and sustainable architecture curricula in India, her journey now aligns with the country’s international climate commitment. Here are excerpts from her candid conversation with CE. What inspired you to choose teaching as your path? Do you remember the teacher who inspired or made an impact on you to fuel that dream?I was in class 8. My brother had finished Engineering and cracked JEE, while my sister had joined MBBS. At that time, when my father asked what I wanted to pursue, I said I wanted to be a teacher. I didn’t know what I wanted to teach, but I think the decision came from the reverence and respect I had for my teachers in school.Later, in my undergraduate programme, I noticed certain traits in my professors that further inspired me to become a teacher myself. I had a professor named Ravi at Anna University. He taught me Basic Design in the first semester and Urban Design in my ninth semester. He was able to come down to the level of a first-semester B Arch student and also managed to relate to us in our final year of undergraduation. His way of teaching was fantastic that one could not take their eyes off the board. He was very punctual to class, and I have also never seen him lose his temper with his students. He would also never go out of his way to cajole students, but if you spoke to him, he would give you time. He was prepared before he came to class, and one could see his preparation, which means he respected his students and their time. All this was at a time when there was no real accountability system in education. There was no NAAC or NBA. I appreciated his passion and he was my biggest inspiration. So, the month I finished my post-graduation, I took up a teaching job. What led you to architecture? How did your interest evolve towards sustainable design?Frankly speaking, I wasn’t very passionate or keen on studying architecture. I had admission letters from multiple institutions outside Chennai after I finished school, but due to certain family situations, I wanted to be closer to home. Hence, I applied to Anna University and I got into the Architecture programme. Within a few weeks, when Professor Ravi taught us, I developed an interest in the subject.I was always very good at Mathematics. What I do today — sustainable architecture — has a lot of math in it. We have to calculate so many things — how energy transfer happens in buildings, how to make buildings comfortable, and so on. I think I found that sweet spot where my liking for architecture, which I had developed over a period of time, and my aptitude in Mathematics came together.What keeps you passionate about teaching after almost three decades in the profession?As teachers, we have the responsibility of training the next generation. When it comes to my domain of architecture, I believe that my generation has done immense damage to the environment. Now it is our duty to help the next generation mend that damage. This aligns with the agenda of the Government of India, which is to make India carbon neutral by 2070. But we have buildings that consume 40 percent of energy. So this gap of traversing to a net carbon-zero country is where, I think, I, as a teacher, am aiming to help students with. That keeps my fire burning. The National Award for Teachers winners with Prime Minister Narendra ModiIn promoting sustainable architectural practices in India, what major challenges do you think architects are encountering, and how should they address them?Firstly, compared to a decade ago, every architect has become aware of sustainability. Even clients have become aware of sustainable architecture, climate-responsive architecture, and that we need to be less energy intensive. But when a client invests his earnings of 30-35 years in a home, he has specificities that he would expect an architect to deliver, which might not be sustainable or help in keeping the building energy-intensive. So there is always the issue of meeting clients’ expectations. To tell them that they will have to live a slightly compromised life to have a sustainable building that doesn’t consume much energy is an issue for architects. That is the challenge they have — of convincing clients.But on the other side, there is a lot of work being done to make energy-neutral building materials. Materials are echo-labelled where the label says how much energy a product has consumed, carbon dioxide it has emitted, and so on. With such products, architects are quantifying the energy that they are consuming, but the confluence of everything isn’t happening today. It will take some time.Are there challenges when it comes to institutional mindsets of evolving architecture curriculum to accommodate sustainability?If you had asked me this question six months back, I would have said that there needs to be a great shift in the mindset. But recently, the Council of Architecture, which is the governing body for architectural education in India, made a separate team of experts to address the question of how to bring in sustainability and address climate change issues in the curriculum, especially the undergraduate one. I was a member too, and I think we have done as much to bring in three aspects — climate change, climate justice, and climate-based rehabilitation — into the curriculum of architecture.The National Award considers teaching-learning effectiveness and outreach. In your view, what makes your teaching effective and impactful?I believe that when a student learns, he shouldn’t just learn to write answers on a question paper. When he leaves, he should carry something significant in his hand. So I make every student go to the site and ask them to investigate the field, applying whatever was taught in theory. They should collect data, and it has to be interpolated. During this process, I also teach them technical writing. I facilitate their study by helping them procure instruments to study the data. Similarly, if there is a building that a student wants to study, and the owner refuses permission, I request them and facilitate the study. I end up handling each student on a one-to-one basis. I get WhatsApp messages at 2.30 am or 3 am saying “Ma’am, the instrument isn’t working” or “The weather was warm till yesterday and now due to thunderstorms the temperature has changed. Should I continue my reading?” My work is 24/7.Almost every student at the end of my course or subject has a technical paper worth publishing. It is then up to them how they want to take the paper forward — publish in journals or books, present it in conferences, or take it up as their PhD. Almost 80% of the students also end up taking the same topic as their dissertation and final thesis because they have invested so much thought, time, and energy into this work for my class. We often focus on new energy-efficient or climate-resilient buildings, but how does your work address making existing structures more sustainable?I teach sustainable architecture because India is a developing country and there is a huge demand for new buildings. In the next 50 years, there will be double the number of buildings. So there is a scope for them to be sustainable. But I also teach students how to retrofit old buildings with technology. That is a work in progress.For instance, how can we use nanotechnology or nano coatings to ensure heat from outside doesn’t come in? This becomes very important for heat-wave-prone places like Andhra Pradesh because disaster management guidelines ask people to stay inside, but the inside is so hot, and people who suffer are mainly women and children. Even those who work in industries like the cottage industry, for example, are already tackling heat stress. How do we make those buildings cool? We can’t say demolish and rebuild; that is where retrofitting comes into the picture. A large part of my research is about retrofitting.I also encourage students to study possibilities of retrofitting the buildings they study because if they take baby steps in one course and take it forward in their dissertation or thesis, when they start moving into the industry, they will think more about retrofitting buildings for energy efficiency.Can you imagine yourself doing anything else besides teaching?I am extremely passionate about my profession. You cannot make me do anything else, and one cannot shake me out of it in exchange for anything in this world. \n",

            "The world we live in today carries the quiet touch of an engineer in every corner of life. Be it the roads we travel, the cars we ride, the elevators that carry us up, or even the invisible networks that connect us through the internet. Yet behind these conveniences lies a bigger question; are we preparing the next generation of engineers to meet global challenges? On September 15, as India celebrates National Engineer’s Day to mark the 164th birth anniversary of Bharat Ratna Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya, we turned to IIT Hyderabad Director Prof Budaraju Srinivasa Murty. He shares his thoughts on urgent reforms in engineering education, the need for innovation over rote learning, and how Indian engineers can stand shoulder to shoulder with the best in the world.ExcerptsAs the Director of IIT Hyderabad, what changes do you believe are most urgent to ensure India produces globally competitive engineers?That’s a very important question ahead of Engineer’s Day. To be honest, very few students today join IITs with the goal of becoming ‘engineers’. Most look for high-paying jobs, often in FinTech and multinational companies. In the past, students came to IITs aspiring to be good mechanical or electrical engineers. That spirit is slowly disappearing. So, the urgent reform is to bring back the culture of real engineering, doing things with one’s own hands. At IIT Hyderabad, we’ve started initiatives like:Innovation Support – Every semester, students can submit innovative project ideas. If selected, we fund them with Rs 1 lakh. They can even take a semester break (with credits) or a diploma break after the 2nd year to focus on their idea, with the option to return within 5 years.The Bharati Initiative – First-semester students are grouped (interdisciplinary) under faculty mentors. They meet weekly, brainstorm, and work hands-on. Students have already built projects like 8-bit computers from scratch.India must move from being only a service country to a product and technology country. I want to see our graduates working at companies like Qualcomm, Tata Motors or launching their own startups, rather than just standing in queues for Infosys or TCS. Already, 25% of IIT Hyderabad’s BTech students are into startups. Do you think India’s current engineering education is aligned with the skills and mindset needed for the industries of tomorrow?Unfortunately, not fully. Traditional branches like civil, mechanical, and electrical are shrinking in many colleges. If this continues, 20 years later, we may need to import engineers to build our bridges and roads. Institutions must work closely with industry and launch need-based programmes. At IIT Hyderabad, we have introduced:BTech in Computational Engineering (launched 2021) : India’s first interdisciplinary programme blending applied mathematics, solid/fluid mechanics, multi-scale modeling, etc, aimed at aerospace, automobiles, and manufacturing.BTech in Electrical Engineering (IC Design & Technology) (launched 2022) : To prepare students for India’s semiconductor mission, focusing on IC design and fabrication.BTech in Industrial Chemistry: To meet industry demand in petrochemicals, textiles, food processing, agriculture, etc, where strong chemistry knowledge is crucial.BTech in Engineering Sciences: A flexible, 130-credit programme where students design their own curriculum across multiple branches. We must also think of future-oriented programs: energy, smart mobility, renewable technologies, and sustainability. What gaps do you see between academic research in engineering and its real-world application in India?The gap is significant. Industries need real products and prototypes, not just papers. If brilliant IIT students vanish into software jobs, manufacturing suffers. At IIT Hyderabad, we try to close this gap through:The TiHAN Hub, where we developed and deployed AI-powered autonomous driverless buses on campus.Collaborative research in Beyond 5G and 6G technologies with international industry partners.Sustainability projects like biodegradable packaging films from sewage sludge and eggshell waste.Academic programmes must connect directly to industry needs.Apart from IITs, lakhs of graduates come out of private colleges every year. Why are those institutes unable to adopt such models?Many private universities actually have more autonomy than IITs. The issue is whether they use that freedom wisely. If they ask, ‘What does India really need?’ and redesign curricula accordingly, transformation is possible. We’ve shown proof of concept. In the past five years:320 startups were incubated at IIT Hyderabad, generating over Rs1,500 crore in revenue.580 patents were filed, with ~220 in the past year alone under our ‘Patent-a-Day’ mission.So, change is possible when institutions take responsibility.Can you share some contributions of Indian engineers in recent decades that you feel are globally underrated?There are many. For instance:Contributions in semiconductors and devices fabrication.India’s role in setting 5G standards, now recognised globally.Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, which was supplied worldwide.Such achievements must be highlighted more to inspire students. The world belongs to AI, what new opportunities will open for engineers in future?AI by itself is not valuable, it needs an application. The future belongs to Engineers + AI.For example: At IIT Hyderabad, we run an MTech in Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME), using AI to design new steels and materials. Our AI faculty come from diverse backgrounds — mechanical, civil, agriculture, electronics — not just computer science. So the future engineer will be someone who knows a core domain plus how to leverage AI in it.If you had the power to change one thing in India’s engineering education today, what would it be?Make education far more hands-on. Out of 130 BTech credits, at least 30–50 should be practical, project-based credits. That shift alone will transform India’s engineers.In your view, who are the greatest engineers India has produced?There are many. To name a few:Dr APJ Abdul Kalam – for his contributions in aerospace and defence.Sir M Visvesvaraya – a legendary civil engineer and statesman.Vikram Sarabhai, Satish Dhawan and other who shaped India’s space programme.Even physicists like Homi J Bhabha, who transformed into nation-builders.India has plenty of role models, we just need to recognise and celebrate them.What is your message to young engineers stepping into today’s uncertain world?Uncertainty exists only in the mind. If you truly enjoy engineering, like I enjoy metallurgy, you’ll always see opportunities. Students must be willing to learn continuously and apply their skills broadly, instead of chasing only one type of job.Finally, if Sir M Visvesvaraya were alive today, what message do you think he would give to engineers?He would tell us: ‘Jump into labs. Don’t sit only in front of computers. Build with your hands. That is how you make India great.’ \n",

            "The fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at an event in Utah had particular resonance for public figures who have experienced political violence themselves. Kirk, who served as chief executive and cofounder of the youth organization Turning Point USA, made frequent appearances on college campuses and in other settings, engaging in political dialogue with students in public settings. Several leaders who have survived public attacks or had family members victimized joined in bipartisan condemnation of the attack on Kirk. The former House speaker's husband was seriously injured at their California home in 2022 by a man wielding a hammer , who authorities said was a believer in conspiracy theories. Pelosi, a Democrat, posted that “the horrific shooting today at Utah Valley University is reprehensible. Political violence has absolutely no place in our nation.” The president sustained a minor ear injury when he was shot at a campaign event last year. He was also the target of a failed assassination attempt while playing golf in Florida. He had a close relationship with Kirk and announced his death Wednesday on his Truth Social site. Trump described Kirk on Truth Social as a “great guy from top to bottom. GOD BLESS HIM!” He also posted, “No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie.\" President Trump also ordered all American flags to be lowered to half-staff until 6 p.m. ET Sunday. The former U.S. representative, a Democrat, suffered a serious brain injury from a 2011 shooting while meeting with constituents at a shopping center in her Arizona congressional district. She survived and has taken up the cause of fighting gun violence. Giffords posted on social media that she was “horrified” to hear of Kirk’s shooting. “Democratic societies will always have political disagreements,\" she wrote, \"but we must never allow America to become a country that confronts those disagreements with violence.\" The House majority leader, a Louisiana Republican, was shot at a practice for a charity baseball game involving members of Congress in the Virginia suburbs in 2017. The man who attacked Scalise had grievances against Trump and Republicans and was later fatally shot by police. Scalise asked people on the social media platform X to “please join me in praying for Charlie Kirk after this senseless act.” The Pennsylvania governor, a Democrat and potential national candidate, was evacuated with his family from the governor's mansion earlier this year after a man broke into the building and set a fire that caused significant damage. “We must speak with moral clarity,\" Shapiro wrote on X. \"The attack on Charlie Kirk is horrifying and this growing type of unconscionable violence cannot be allowed in our society.” The Michigan governor, a Democrat, was the subject of a failed kidnapping plot by right-wing extremists who hoped to ignite a civil war. Two men were imprisoned for their 2020 attempt to kidnap the governor during her first term. “We should all come together to stand up against any and all forms of political violence,\" Whitmer wrote on social media. The Health and Human Services secretary appeared to invoke his family’s losses as he reacted to Kirk’s killing. Kennedy’s father, for whom he was named, was assassinated in 1968 as he sought the Democratic presidential nomination. Kennedy Sr. was an outspoken critic of the Vietnam War and an advocate for civil rights legislation as attorney general during his brother’s presidency and after John F. Kennedy’s assassination in 1963. “Once again, a bullet has silenced the most eloquent truth teller of an era,” Kennedy wrote on social media. He called Kirk a “relentless and courageous crusader for free speech.” Kirk’s killing follows instances of political violence in the United States in recent months, including the shooting of two different Minnesota state lawmakers and their spouses in June. Vance Boelter is accused of posing as a police officer and fatally shooting Minnesota House of Representatives Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark . Boelter also allegedly shot Minnesota Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, at their home in a nearby neighborhood. Hoffman and his wife survived the shooting. On Sen. Hoffman's Facebook page, the Hoffman family released a statement, saying, \"America is broken, and political violence endangers our lives and democracy. The assassination of Charlie Kirk today is only the latest act that our country cannot continue to accept. Our leaders of both parties must not only tone down their own rhetoric, but they must begin to call out extreme, aggressive, and violent dialogue that foments these attacks on our republic and freedom. We also call on leaders of both parties to take immediate action to prevent gun violence. Our prayers are with the Kirk family, our state, and our country.\" Shortly after news broke that Kirk was shot, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, took to X, formerly known as Twitter, to offer condolences and decry political violence. \"An open forum for political dialogue and disagreement was upended by a horrific act of targeted violence. In America, we don’t settle our differences with violence or at gunpoint. I’m praying for Charlie, his family, and his young children,\" Walz wrote. U.S. Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith, both Minnesota Democrats, as well as Minnesota members of the U.S. House, posted to social media offering condolences and denouncing political violence. \n",

            "Imagine charging your electric car almost as quickly as filling a petrol tank, and that’s exactly what Mercedes-Benz just showed off at the IAA Auto Show in Munich with its AMG GT XX concept. In testing, the EV reached a peak charging speed of 1014 kW, which is over 1 megawatt, a world first for passenger cars. To simplify it, the car absorbed as much energy in one minute as a Toyota RAV4 plug-in hybrid can hold in its entire battery. More impressive is that the GT XX managed to sustain that mega speed charging for over two and a half minutes. So, to pull this off, two breakthroughs made it possible: 1. A direct-cooled battery using special nonconductive oil to keep over 3,000 cells at the right temperature. 2. A liquid-cooled charging cable, which is originally designed for electric trucks, adapted for the car. This was surely a prototype setup with experimental equipment, but Mercedes says this is not just a science experiment. The direct-cooled battery technology will soon be in the production AMG GT and the brand’s upcoming AMG.EA platform. On the charging side, Mercedes is already working on 600-kW chargers for North America, inspired by this project. While it will take time for everyday drivers to see such speeds at public stations, this breakthrough chips away at one of the biggest complaints about EVs, that is long charging times. The future of “refueling” your EV in just a few minutes may not be too far away. For more international market updates, keep reading Times Now Auto. \n",

            "The Democratic National Committee is launching a fresh round of digital ads in Iowa targeting Republican U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, part of a broader campaign to pressure House Republicans who voted against forcing the Department of Justice to release files related to late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, by blocking Democratic procedural maneuvers in the House. The new spots follow Monday’s release by the House Oversight Committee of a birthday album that included letters, signatures and names of high-profile figures, among them former President Bill Clinton and attorney Alan Dershowitz. It also includes a sexually suggestive letter to Epstein purportedly signed by President Donald Trump. Trump has denied writing the letter to Epstein, dismissing the document as a hoax and claiming his signature was forged. People are also reading...

The disgraced financier died by suicide in 2019 while in jail awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges. The DNC says its ads will run across several social media platforms in Iowa’s 1st Congressional District, highlighting what Democrats call Republican “cowardice” in shielding Trump from scrutiny. “If House Republicans can’t even stand up for the victims and survivors of a notorious sexual predator, then how can their voters trust them?” DNC chair Ken Martin said in a statement. The digital campaign is not the first time Democrats have sought to tie Iowa Republicans to the controversy over Epstein. In July, the DNC rolled out ads against U.S. Reps. Ashley Hinson and Zach Nunn, criticizing their opposition to Democratic-led efforts to force disclosure of the files. At the time, Democrats argued GOP lawmakers had broken with their own campaign trail promises to support transparency. The latest offensive underscores how national Democrats view the Epstein case as both a moral and political issue, particularly in battleground districts like Miller-Meeks’ Eastern Iowa seat. Republicans, for their part, have argued Democrats are using Epstein’s crimes for political gain, and have accused Democrats of being hypocritical, arguing that they could have called for the release of the files at any time while former President Joe Biden was in office. “We deserve transparency and honesty from our government,” Miller-Meeks said in a statement to The Gazette. “For four years, Joe Biden and Democrats ignored the opportunity to deliver truth. I stand with President Trump in his efforts to ensure transparency into Jeffrey Epstein’s heinous crimes while protecting the victims who endured so much abuse.” Emily Tuttle, a spokeswoman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, echoed Miller-Meeks. “Democrats could’ve spent their four years under Joe Biden fighting for victims, but instead tanked the economy, endangered communities with pro-crime policies, and opened our borders to illegal criminals all while covering up Biden’s decline,\" Tuttle said in a statement to The Gazette. \"Republicans will not be lectured on transparency or accountability by the Democrat Party.” The House fight over releasing the Epstein files has become an increasingly sharp point of partisan division. While some Republicans initially voiced support for disclosure, Democrats say most have since retreated under pressure from Trump. With control of the House on the line in 2026, the DNC’s renewed push signals it intends to keep the issue in the spotlight as part of its broader argument that Republicans are unwilling to stand up to the former president, even on matters involving transparency. More Republicans rally behind Hinson’s U.S. Senate campaign More Iowa Republicans are lining up behind U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson as she launches her campaign for U.S. Senate. Former Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad endorsed Hinson, praising her as “the proven conservative leader we need at this critical moment for our nation,” according to a social media post by Hinson’s campaign . “I have worked alongside Ashley and President Trump to enact policies that strengthen Iowa, unleash our economy, and protect our national security,” Branstad, who served as U.S. ambassador to China during Trump’s first term, said in a statement. “ ... In the United States Senate, Ashley will be a fearless ally of President Trump and a relentless fighter for the ‘America First’ agenda.” Joining Branstad in lending her support is fellow Republican Iowa U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks. “From fighting China’s growing influence to defending America's jobs and families, Ashley has proven herself to be a warrior in Washington — and is ready to take the fight to the Senate,” Miller-Meeks said, according to a social media post by Hinson’s campaign . Hinson, who represents northeast Iowa’s 2nd District in the U.S. House, is vying to succeed retiring Iowa GOP U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst in the 2026 election. Ernst announced last week she will not seek a third term. Trump offered his “complete and total endorsement” of Hinson’s Senate bid via a Truth Social post Friday, praising her record in Iowa. Trump’s backing bolsters Hinson as the clear front-runner in the Republican primary, reinforcing her ties to the Trump-aligned MAGA base. The president’s early approval and Hinson’s growing list of endorsements could discourage additional challengers and help rally GOP unity behind Hinson. Hinson is one of two Republicans in the 2026 Senate race. The other is Jim Carlin, of Sioux City, a staunch pro-Trump conservative who criticized U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley for not pushing to investigate unsubstantiated allegations of widespread fraud in the 2020 presidential election. Carlin blasted Hinson as a “phony” after she received Trump’s endorsement, arguing she lacks credibility with Iowa conservatives. “Ashley Hinson never supported Trump and didn’t say one word on his behalf until after the caucuses. She is an actress reading D.C.’s script — she’s not a conservative, not America First and certainly not MAGA,” Carlin said in a statement. The Sioux City attorney and former state senator criticized Hinson’s record, citing her vote to certify the 2020 election, her support of former Rep. Liz Cheney as House Republican Conference chair, and backing for codifying same-sex marriage. Hinson, however, supported Cheney's ouster from the position in 2021, after Cheney called out Trump and fellow Republicans for spreading false claims about the 2020 election. Hinson and other top House Republicans advocated for New York Rep. Elise Stefanik to replace Cheney in House GOP leadership. State Rep. Mark Cisneros, R-Muscatine, on Wednesday endorsed Carlin, praising his “principled leadership” and “unwavering commitment to conservative, constitutional values.” Carlin has also secured endorsements from Republican state Sens. Kevin Alons, Doug Campbell, Sandy Salmon and state Rep. Samantha Fett. The backing comes as Carlin positions himself as a grassroots conservative alternative to Hinson’s D.C.-backed bid. Joshua Smith, a former Libertarian, announced early this year he planned to run as a Republican to challenge Ernst in the GOP primary. Smith released a campaign ad, but has not yet filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to register a campaign for the seat. He created a skeleton campaign website with a brief bio and a “donate now” button that states: “Full website coming soon.” Grassley signals support for Hinson but stops short of endorsement Iowa Republican U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley on Wednesday praised Iowa GOP U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson as “fully qualified” to succeed retiring Iowa U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst but stopped short of a formal endorsement, saying his focus is on Republicans winning across the ballot in 2026. Asked directly if he would endorse Hinson’s Senate campaign, Grassley said he has worked with her during her years in the U.S. House and considers her well-prepared to seek the office. “Even though I’m disappointed Joni’s retiring, I think Ashley (is) fully qualified to succeed her, and I guess I’ll leave it at that at this point,” Grassley told reporters during a conference call. The state’s senior senator added that the party faces competitive races at the top of the ticket for both the Senate seat and governor and in two of Iowa’s congressional districts, and stressed unity. “The bottom line ... is that we’re going to win in 2026,” Grassley said. Lindsay James lands wave of Democratic endorsements for 2nd Congressional District State Rep. Lindsay James of Dubuque announced Wednesday she has secured endorsements from 30 Democratic leaders across Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District as she campaigns for the newly open U.S. House seat. Several Democratic candidates are in the field, including Cedar Rapids nonprofit leader Clint Twedt-Ball, veteran and former community college nursing dean Kathy Dolter of Cedar Rapids, and former state park manager Don Primus of Steamboat Rock. James’ backers include former U.S. Reps. Dave Loebsack and Abby Finkenauer, along with 27 current and former elected officials and activists. “I am proud to have earned the trust and support of this broad base of Democratic leaders representing every part of our district,” James said in a statement. “With their support ... we’re building the momentum and grassroots support needed to win this seat and build a stronger, fairer Iowa.” The endorsements come as the race turned into an open-seat election last week when Republican incumbent Ashley Hinson announced her intention to run for U.S. Senate. Republicans have a voter registration advantage of around 23,000 voters over Democrats in the district, which includes Cedar Rapids, Waterloo, Dubuque, Decorah, Grinnell and Mason City. President Donald Trump won the district by 10 percentage points in 2024, increasing his margin from 2020. National Democrats, however, have already targeted the district as competitive and see it as a top pickup opportunity in 2026. Loebsack, who represented the district for 14 years, praised James as a leader who “listens to people in communities large and small and works to improve their daily lives.” Finkenauer, who served one term in Congress before being defeated by Hinson in 2020, described James as a fighter who “never backs down” and is focused on working families. Other notable backers include former state Sen. Liz Mathis of Hiawatha and a slate of local leaders from across Eastern Iowa. \n",

            "\"हे भगवान, आप लोग किस स्पीड से बोलते हैं। लगता है जैसे यह तेज \"कैटामारन' उमड़ते समुद्र पर उड़ रही हो।' यह बात उन विदेशी पर्यटकों ने कही, जो हमारे साथ रामेश्वरम में दो पतवारों वाली नाव में बैठे थे। मेरे पिता ने शांत होकर उनसे कहा कि उन्होंने नाव के लिए जो शब्द \"कैटामारन' काम में लिया, वह उस तमिल भाषा का है- जो रामेश्वरम् और पूरे तमिलनाडु में बोली जाती है। फिर उन्होंने समझाया कि यह शब्द तमिल के \"कट्टुमरम' से लिया गया है, जिसका अर्थ है एक साथ बंधे हुए लट्ठे। इस तरह के शुरुआती डिजाइन मछली पकड़ने के लिए इस्तेमाल होते थे। उस विदेशी ने मेरे पिता की अंग्रेजी में दक्षता की तारीफ की, जो उसके अनुसार \"किसी अंग्रेज की तरह सटीक' थी। मुझे 70 के दशक में अपने माता-पिता के साथ यात्रा का यह किस्सा तब याद आया, जब इंदौर विश्वविद्यालय के एक छात्र ने मुझसे पूछा, \"आप इतने छोटे से छोटे दशमलव और कई संख्याओं को उनके प्रतिशत के साथ कैसे याद रखते हैं? और यहां दे रहे हर जवाब में उन्हें समझा भी पाते हैं?' कॉलेजों, विश्वविद्यालयों और स्कूलों में विद्यार्थी अक्सर ये सवाल पूछते हैं। मैं अपने हाथ आकाश की ओर उठाकर इसका श्रेय माता-पिता को देता हूं, जिनकी याददाश्त 80 की उम्र के बाद भी तेज थी और उन्होंने मुझे भी वही डीएनए दिया। और भगवान को भी श्रेय देता हूं, जिन्होंने माता-पिता को बनाया। वर्षों बाद मुझे पता चला कि इसके पीछे विज्ञान है और कोई भी ऐसी याददाश्त विकसित कर सकता है। कई भाषाएं जानना स्पष्ट रूप से बुजुर्गों में कॉग्निटिव हेल्थ से जुड़ा है, जो उम्र संबंधी गिरावट को धीमा करता है। लेकिन यह शारीरिक तौर पर उम्रदराज होने को रोकता नहीं है। माना जाता है कि बहुभाषावाद एक \"कॉग्निटिव रिजर्व' में योगदान देता है, जो मस्तिष्क को उम्र संबंधी बदलावों से निपटने में मदद करता है। सोच रहे हैं कि बहुभाषावाद संज्ञान संबंधी ताकत कैसे बढ़ाता है? तो जानिए, यह कैसे काम करता है। 1. एग्जीक्यूटिव क्रियाकलापों को मजबूत करता है : बहुभाषी व्यक्तियों को जानी-पहचानी भाषाओं को लगातार प्रबंधित और बदलते रहना होता है। इससे मस्तिष्क के एग्जीक्यूटिव कंट्रोल सिस्टम का व्यायाम होता है। इससे व्यक्ति के जीवन में ध्यान, कार्य-बदलाव और संयम जैसी क्षमताएं मजबूत होती हैं। 2. दिमाग की प्लास्टिसिटी बढ़ाता है : द्विभाषी और बहुभाषी व्यक्तियों के मस्तिष्क के कुछ क्षेत्रों में ‘ग्रे मैटर’ का घनत्व बढ़ा हुआ होता है। खासकर उन क्षेत्रों में, जो भाषा और एग्जीक्यूटिव कार्यों से संबंधित होते हैं। यह न्यूरोलॉजिकल प्लास्टिसिटी अथवा दिमाग की स्वयं को पुनर्गठित करने की क्षमता बढ़ती उम्र के साथ कॉग्निटिव तीक्ष्णता बनाए रखने में मदद करती है। कॉग्निटिव रिजर्व बढ़ाता है : माना जाता है कि कई भाषाएं सीखने और उपयोग करने के मस्तिष्क-उत्तेजक प्रभावों से कॉग्निटिव रिजर्व का निर्माण होता है। यह एक बफर जैसा है, जो लंबे समय तक बिना कोई लक्षण दिखाए दिमाग को न्यूरो डी-जनेरेटिव रोगों जैसे नुकसान को सहने की क्षमता देता है। हम इस न्यूरो डी-जनेरेटिव रोग को डिमेंशिया के रूप में भी जानते हैं। हां, कई भाषाएं सीखना और बोलना उल्लेखनीय ढंग से मस्तिष्क को उम्र संबंधी गिरावट से बचाता है। यह संज्ञानात्मक रूप से उम्रदराज होने और डिमेंशिया को विलंबित करता है। चूंकि कई भाषाओं को प्रबंधित करने में निरंतर संज्ञान संबंधी प्रयासों की जरूरत होती है, इसलिए बहुभाषी व्यक्ति अक्सर बेहतर कॉग्निटिव कार्यक्षमता का प्रदर्शन करते हैं- जिसमें एग्जीक्यूटिव कंट्रोल और ध्यान शामिल हैं। यह \"कॉग्निटिव रिजर्व' बहुभाषी दिमाग को लंबे समय तक मस्तिष्क के क्षय को झेलने के काबिल बनाता है। भाषा सीखने के मस्तिष्क पर होने वाले सकारात्मक प्रभाव बचपन तक सीमित नहीं हैं। वयस्क भी दूसरी या तीसरी भाषा सीखकर महत्वपूर्ण सुधार कर सकते हैं। ऐसा नहीं है कि बहुभाषी मस्तिष्क की उम्र नहीं बढ़ती, बल्कि इसके बजाय वे उम्र संबंधी बदलावों को सहन करने में अधिक बेहतर होते हैं। फंडा यह है कि शोध दिखाता है कि एकाग्रता और दिमागी चुस्ती वाले कार्यों में अक्सर बहुभाषी लोग एक भाषा जानने वालों से बेहतर प्रदर्शन करते हैं। कोई भी, किसी भी उम्र में नई भाषा सीख सकता है। \n",

            "An affidavit by Canada’s deputy chief veterinarian says new analysis has confirmed ostriches at a B.C. farm that is fighting a cull order for its flock were sickened by a unique and more lethal strain of the avian influenza virus.

The strain was “among the most virulent” tested at Canada’s National Microbiology Laboratory and even low doses killed mice within a few days, the document says. But Furness says the CFIA doesn’t know how likely it is that the ostriches at the Edgewood farm remain infected, or will become infected. The document was filed on Tuesday with the Federal Court of Appeal, where the agency is arguing against another stay delaying the cull of about 400 ostriches. Katie Pasitney, farm spokeswoman and daughter of its co-owner, says in a Facebook post they are “actively responding” to filings by the Justice Department. “We are putting in our reconsideration material as well,” she says in the post on Wednesday, adding the farm would be providing further updates. The farm’s owners have long said the flock is healthy, acquiring “herd immunity” since the CFIA ordered the cull on Dec. 31, 2024, during an outbreak that went on to kill 69 birds. Furness’s filing follows a Federal Court of Appeal ruling granting the farm an interim stay and delaying the cull as it seeks a hearing at the Supreme Court of Canada. Advertisement embed-more-topic Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. She says the new information “increases the potential animal and human health risks associated with the ongoing delay” and “decontamination” of exposed areas. Furness says a review of scientific literature and information from a veterinary epidemiologist with the federal agency show ostriches can shed large amounts of avian influenza and continue shedding without showing signs of infection. “That is, infected ostriches may still be shedding virus through their urine, feces, and respiratory secretions, despite appearing healthy. This is referred to as ‘silent shedding’, which is also observed in some other birds, like ducks,” the filing says. Universal Ostrich Farms has repeatedly called for testing to determine whether the birds are infected with H5N1. Furness says the chances they are infected or will become infected “is unknown by CFIA, due to gaps in the available science regarding how long immunity to (avian influenza) viruses may last in an individual ostrich,” as well as a lack of information about how many ostriches were infected during the original outbreak. The affidavit says the requirements for a cull were met on Dec. 31, 2024, “and the policy does not provide for additional testing.” In any case, Furness says, testing could only provide additional evidence of current risk. It would not address the unknown risks of reinfection or the risks associated with the “contaminated environment,” she says in the document. Furness says the CFIA’s risk assessment is also informed by the farm owners’ “inability or unwillingness” to comply with quarantine rules. Avian influenza viruses can survive for months or even years in fresh water at low temperatures and have been documented surviving in manure and on feathers in low temperatures for about four to six months, the affidavit says. “Therefore, a source of infection or reinfection with (avian influenza) can remain in the environment long after individual infected birds have recovered,” it says. Universal Ostrich Farms has maintained the birds should be spared because they are scientifically valuable and pose no threat. The farm has lost in Federal Court and the Federal Court of Appeal, but last Thursday its lawyer sought another stay on the cull order, filing a series of documents as the farm pursues a hearing in Canada’s High Court. In a decision dated Sept. 6, the Appeal Court granted the interim stay until the stay motion “is decided on the basis of a full record.” The interim stay motion says the farm was to have until Wednesday to respond to the latest filings by the CFIA. It says the agency is still allowed to take preparatory steps to kill the birds. The CFIA says on its website that allowing a flock previously exposed to avian influenza to remain alive means a potential source of the virus persists and increases the risk of reassortment or mutation of the virus. The farm’s situation has drawn attention from officials in the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, including Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has repeatedly called for the animals to be spared and studied. Supporters seeking to avert a cull have also been camping out at the farm and staging concerts. \n",

            "Charlie Kirk, the CEO and co-founder of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA, was fatally shot Wednesday while speaking at an event at a Utah college, officials said. Videos posted to social media show Kirk speaking into a handheld microphone at Utah Valley University in Sorensen Center courtyard, sitting under a white tent emblazoned with the slogans, “The American Comeback” and “Prove Me Wrong.” A single shot rings out and Kirk reaches up with his hand as a large volume of blood gushes from the left side of his neck. Stunned spectators gasp and scream. Some run away. The shooting quickly drew reaction from leading political figures, including some victims of political violence. Here’s the latest: Moments before the shooting Video shows Kirk had been taking questions from an audience member about mass shootings and gun violence. “Do you know how many transgender Americans have been mass shooters over the last 10 years?” an audience member asked. Kirk responded, “Too many.” The questioner followed up: “Do you know how many mass shooters there have been in America over the last 10 years?” “Counting or not counting gang violence?” Kirk asked. Then a single shot rang out. Thousands turned out for Kirk’s appearance and police were also present Jeff Long, chief of Utah Valley University Police Department, says six officers working at Kirk’s campus event and more than 3,000 people were in attendance. The police chief says his officers coordinated their operation with Kirk’s security team, and plainclothes police officers were also present. At the time he was shot, Kirk was speaking to the throng in a low area surrounded by campus buildings. Long said law enforcement tries to get the “bases covered.” But he added, “unfortunately today we didn’t, and because of that we have this tragic incident.” Students, meanwhile, told The Associated Press they saw no metal detectors or bag checks. The amount of security appeared consistent with other speaking engagements on Kirk’s national tour. Suspect released, shooter still at large: FBI director The suspect in the killing of Charlie Kirk has been released after an interrogation with law enforcement, according to FBI Director Kash Patel. “The subject in custody has been released after an interrogation by law enforcement. Our investigation continues and we will continue to release information in interest of transparency,” Patel said in a post on X. Tammy Ibrahimpoor, CTV News producer FBI appeals to the public for information about the shooting The FBI’s Salt Lake City office has added an online form to its website where the public can report information about Kirk’s killing. The form says the FBI is “seeking information regarding the shooting at Utah Valley University that took place on September 10, 2025.” It asks the person submitting the form to include their name and contact information and then includes a section for information about the incident. Donald Trump Jr. says Kirk wasn’t a threat to anyone In a lengthy social media post, President Trump’s son says Kirk wasn’t just a friend, but was “like a little brother to me” and a “true inspiration.” Trump Jr. said Kirk “changed the direction of this nation” because “there is no question that Charlie’s work and his voice helped my father win the presidency.” He said Kirk was civil and kind, and listened and responded with respect. “The only `threat’ he ever posed was that he was incredibly effective. He was a powerful messenger of truth, and people heard that truth. That’s what made him a target.” Democrats in Congress mourn Kirk Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell of Michigan appeared visibly upset while speaking to reporters on the steps of the U.S. Capitol. She said that she cried when she found out that Kirk had died. “All of us have got to work together and deescalate the heat and the rhetoric in this country, she said. Dingell added: “And remember we’re Americans, and you can disagree in a way that doesn’t end in the horrible way today did.” Rep. Jamie Raskin expressed condolences to Kirk’s family, adding, “What a nightmare this whole thing is.” “It’s a very dark time with the political violence spiraling out of control and gun violence a threat to everybody,” Raskin continued. Utah governor says Kirk’s death carries a tragic message for the state of the country Gov. Spencer Cox said that Kirk had come to the Utah Valley University campus to represent his conservative views and debate. Targeting people for their ideas threatens the country’s “constitutional foundations,” he said. “We just need every single person in this country to think about where we are and where we want to be,” he said. “I don’t care what his politics are. I care that he was an American.” Cox said the first of the inalienable rights enshrined in the Declaration of Independence is “life, and today a life was taken. Charlie Kirk was first and foremost a husband and a dad to young children. He was also very much politically involved. And that’s why he was here on campus. Charlie believed in the power of free speech and debate to shape ideas and to persuade people.” President of the university where Kirk was killed calls his death tragic Utah Valley University President Astrid Tuminez posted on X that the school is “shocked and saddened” by Kirk’s death. She expressed her condolences to his family and said they are grieving with the many people from the school who saw the “unspeakable tragedy” unfold. “We firmly believe that UVU is a place to share ideas and to debate openly and respectfully. Any attempt to infringe on those rights has no place here,” the statement said. Kirk backers leave flowers at Turning Point headquarters The flags outside Turning Point USA’s Phoenix headquarters have been lowered to half staff. Bouquets of flowers delivered by well-wishers are piling up by the main door to one of at least three buildings that make up Turning Point’s campus. The organization’s presence has grown steadily in a quiet neighborhood at the base of South Mountain park. Former President George W. Bush says violence must be `purged from the public square’ Bush lamented the killing and said “an open exchange of opposing ideas should be sacrosanct” on a college campus, where Kirk was shot. In his statement, Bush added: “Members of other political parties are not our enemies; they are our fellow citizens.” The Republican ex-president closed the statement by asking God to bless Kirk and his family and “guide America toward civility.” Another former president, Democrat Bill Clinton, wrote on X that he was saddened and angered by the killing, adding he hoped “we all go through some serious introspection” and “redouble our efforts to engage in debate passionately, yet peacefully.” Kirk follower says he went to Turning Point USA’s headquarters to give large donation in person Retiree Alex Lane said news of Kirk’s killing prompted him to head to the organization’s Phoenix headquarters and hand the organization a $10,000 check. “I hope and trust that they’re going to continue with the message that he had,” Lane, 54, told The Associated Press while standing outside the headquarters. Lane said he was a follower of Kirk’s and had given to Turning Point before, but never such a large sum. “It’s a huge loss, there’s no question about it,” Lane said. “But I think the important thing for people to understand is that (Kirk’s message) is going to continue. The assassin didn’t stop it. If anything, I think it will bring more attention to his message.” Lawmakers reflect on Kirk’s influence Multiple Republicans in Congress knew Kirk personally and were devastated by his death. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida spoke on the Capitol steps, reflecting on his influence on her political journey. Luna said she was planning to go to medical school before Kirk recruited her to work as his national Hispanic outreach director. She attended events where Kirk debated students, like the one he hosted today. “That conversation needs to happen,” Luna said. “You can’t squelch that.” Kirk killed with single shot in supposed targeted attack, authorities say Utah Gov. Spencer Cox called the killing a “political assassination.” A “person of interest” was in custody Wednesday evening, Cox said, though no charges were immediately announced. “This is a dark day for our state,” Cox said. “We are actively looking for anyone and everyone who has any information related to the shooting,” he said. Utah authorities said the shooter wore dark clothing and fired from a roof on campus some distance away. RFK Jr., son and nephew of assassinated leaders, laments another loss Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appeared to invoke his family’s losses as he reacted to Kirk’s killing. “Once again, a bullet has silenced the most eloquent truth teller of an era,” Kennedy wrote on social media. He called Kirk a “relentless and courageous crusader for free speech.” Kennedy’s father, for whom he was named, was assassinated in 1968 as he sought the Democratic presidential nomination. The elder Kennedy was an outspoken critic of the Vietnam War before many elected leaders in Washington. He also had been an advocate for civil rights legislation as attorney general during his brother’s presidency and after John F. Kennedy’s assassination in 1963. Person suspected in fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk now in custody, FBI director says The person suspected of fatally shooting conservative activist Charlie Kirk on a Utah college campus Wednesday is now in custody, according to a social media post from FBI Director Kash Patel. Kirk fans pay their respects at the Turning Point headquarters in Phoenix One man delivered flowers and wiped tears from his face as he left. He said he was too broken up to speak to reporters. On the sidewalk, 14-year-old Samuel Monahan embraced his parents in prayer. “This is what happens when we’re without God,” said Monahan. The teenager said he admired Kirk for being a man of God who cared about people. The country is so polarized, he said, “but it didn’t have to be that way because we all bow our heads under one flag and under one God.” Former President Obama condemns Kirk’s `despicable’ killing “This kind of despicable violence has no place in our democracy,” former President Barack Obama wrote on X. He said he and former first lady Michelle Obama will pray for Kirk’s wife and two young children. Chaffetz says he’s angry about Kirk’s death “It makes me mad. I’m so mad that this happened in our backyard. It’s an embarrassment,” the Utah Republican former member of Congress told Fox News Channel. Chaffetz was at the event where Kirk was shot. “We’re better than this, but there’s somebody out there who is evil, absolute total, complete evil and they need to be taken down,” he said. Kirk’s appearance at Utah Valley University marked the kickoff of his national college tour He was calling it “The American Comeback Tour.” And he was featuring his “Prove Me Wrong Table,” where Kirk sat, as he was Wednesday, and fielded questions from students, including those who disagreed with him. He also had appearances slated for Colorado State University, the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, Virginia Tech University, Utah State University, the University of North Dakota, Montana State University, Indiana University Louisiana State University and the University of Mississippi over the next two months. The scene around campus Armed officers are walking around the neighborhood bordering the campus, knocking on doors and asking for information on the shooter. Officers have been seen looking at a photo on their phones and showing it to people to see if they recognize a person of interest. Mayor urges people to report anything suspicious Mayor David Young of the north-central Utah city of Orem says several local, state and federal law enforcement agencies are investigating and that the suspect in Kirk’s shooting remains at large. Young says police in Orem and at Utah Valley University are among many agencies involved in the investigation. Meanwhile, authorities have told anyone at Utah Valley University to ‘secure in place’ after Wednesday’s shooting. The campus was closed, and a post on the school’s emergency information page told those still on campus to call officials to be escorted out. An increase in violence against public officials Kirk’s killing follows instances of political violence in the United States in recent months, including the assassination of a Democratic Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband in June and the fatal shooting of two Israeli Embassy staffers in Washington in May. Though little is known about the shooter or the motive in this case, it can’t be ignored that polarization and normalization of violence have become threaded through U.S. politics, said Kurt Braddock, an assistant professor of public communication at American University. Braddock pointed to data from Princeton University’s Bridging Divides Initiative, which shows that threat and harassment incidents against local officials also have been gradually increasing. “We’re moving in a very dangerous direction, and I think we have been moving in this direction for quite some time,” Braddock said. Charlie Kirk is dead, Trump says Trump says the conservative activist and his close ally died Wednesday after being shot at a college event in Utah. The president posted on Truth Social that the conservative activist and his close ally died Wednesday after being shot at a college event in Utah. “No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie. He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us.” Person arrested is not a suspect, AP source says A person who was taken into custody at Utah Valley University was not the suspect, according to a person familiar with the investigation who was not authorized to speak publicly. It was not clear if authorities were still searching the campus for a suspect. Michelle L. Price Trump says Kirk ‘was a very, very good friend’ In a phone interview with the New York Post, Trump said Kirk is “not doing well” and “it looks very bad.” “He was a very, very good friend of mine and he was a tremendous person,” Trump said. Kirk invite to Dartmouth College campus was in demand: school president Dartmouth College President Sian Beilock says a bipartisan student group invited Kirk to that Ivy League campus for a Sept. 25 event. Beilock says the event “was sold out within 10 minutes.” Beilock made the comment during a media event Wednesday with other college presidents. Victims of political violence show support for Kirk Former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, posted that “the horrific shooting today at Utah Valley University is reprehensible. Political violence has absolutely no place in our nation.” Pelosi’s husband was seriously injured in 2022 by a man wielding a hammer, who authorities said was a believer in conspiracy theories. Former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who suffered a serious brain injury in a 2011 shooting in Arizona, said she was “horrified” to hear of Kirk’s shooting. “Democratic societies will always have political disagreements, but we must never allow America to become a country that confronts those disagreements with violence,” she said on social media. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat and potential national candidate, said, “We must speak with moral clarity. The attack on Charlie Kirk is horrifying and this growing type of unconscionable violence cannot be allowed in our society.” A fire was set at his house. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who was the subject of a kidnapping plot, said on social media that “we should all come together to stand up against any and all forms of political violence.” Two men were imprisoned for their 2020 plot to kidnap the governor during her first term. A Republican at the event says he heard one shot A former U.S. representative for Utah’s 3rd congressional district, Jason Chaffetz, says when the shot rang out, Kirk had just been asked a question by someone in the crowd about transgender people and shootings. “As soon as I saw Charlie go back, you realize that it was a shot,” Chaffetz says. “It wasn’t as if there was a whole bunch of gunfire. It was one shot.” Elected officials react to the shooting U.S. Vice-President JD Vance: “Dear God, protect Charlie in his darkest hour.” Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg: “Political violence must be always and totally rejected,” Buttigieg wrote on X. “Praying for him and all who may have been injured or impacted.” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker: “The attack on Charlie Kirk is horrifying. Political violence has no place in this country and should never become the norm. I’m sending my sympathies to his family and friends at this time.” Former North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper: “Violence is unacceptable. I strongly condemn the attack on Charlie Kirk and political violence in all forms. I’m praying for his swift recovery.” New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani: “I’m horrified by the shooting of Charlie Kirk at a college event in Utah. Political violence has no place in our country.” North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein: “We can never tolerate or become numb to political violence. Our nation is weaker when people are afraid to share their opinions or disagree. Please join Anna and me in praying for Charlie Kirk’s recovery.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: “Praying for @charliekirk11′′ Maryland Gov. Wes Moore: “I condemn in the strongest possible terms the attack on Charlie Kirk this afternoon at Utah Valley University. As I have said in the past and as I will continue to say: Political violence is never acceptable. Ever.” Kirk is in critical condition A law enforcement official briefed on the shooting told The Associated Press that Kirk is being treated and is in critical condition. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. By Alana Durkin Richer Utah Valley University is the state’s largest public university With nearly 47,000 students, Utah Valley University has grown to become the largest public university in Utah. It’s located about 40 miles (65 kilometres) south of Salt Lake City, the state capital, and was founded in 1941 as a vocation school. From those beginnings, its enrollment has jumped five-fold over the past three decades. The college is not affiliated or owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, known widely as the Mormon church. Bipartisan rejections of political violence continue Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat and a potential 2028 presidential candidate, called the shooting “chilling & horrific” in an X post. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, another Democrat and potential national candidate, said, “We must speak with moral clarity. The attack on Charlie Kirk is horrifying and this growing type of unconscionable violence cannot be allowed in our society.” Republican Senate Leader John Thune of South Dakota posted: “There is no place in our country for political violence. Period, full stop.” Gabby Giffords says she is horrified about the shooting Giffords, a former U.S. representative for Arizona who suffered a serious brain injury when she was shot in 2011, posted on X about the attack on Kirk. “I’m horrified to hear that Charlie Kirk was shot at an event in Utah,” she wrote Wednesday. “Democratic societies will always have political disagreements, but we must never allow America to become a country that confronts those disagreements with violence.” Kirk was speaking at a debate hosted by Turning Point USA when he was shot The event at Utah Valley University had been met with divided opinions on campus. An online petition calling for university administrators to bar Kirk from appearing receiving nearly 1,000 signatures. The university issued a statement last week citing First Amendment rights and affirming its “commitment to free speech, intellectual inquiry, and constructive dialogue.” U.S. President Trump said on Truth Social that “we must all pray for Charlie Kirk.” “A great guy from top to bottom. GOD BLESS HIM!” the president said in a post on Truth Social. FBI Director Kash Patel said the FBI is “closely monitoring reports of the tragic shooting involving Charlie Kirk.” U.S. Vice-President JD Vance also called for prayers, calling Charlie Kirk “a genuinely good guy and a young father.” Health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Attorney General Pam Bondi, and House Speaker Mike Johnson joined the chorus of Trump officials offering their prayers to Kirk. Support also came from across the aisle. California Gov. Gavin Newsom called the shooting “disgusting, vile, and reprehensible. In the United States of America, we must reject political violence in EVERY form.” Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said: “Political violence has absolutely no place in our nation.” Aubrey Laitsch at Turning Point USA confirms Charlie Kirk has been hospitalized. “He is in the hospital, and we are praying for him at this time,” said Aubrey Laitsch, public relations manager for Turning Point USA. Former Utah congressman says Kirk had some security but not enough Jason Chaffetz, a Republican who was at the event, said told Fox News Channel that he heard one shot and saw Kirk go back. “It seemed like it was a close shot,” Chaffetz said, who seemed shaken as he spoke. He said there was a light police presence at the event and Kirk had some security but not enough. “Utah is one of the safest places on the planet,” he said. “And so we just don’t have these types of things.” \n",

            "NASA Mars rover Perseverance has uncovered rocks in a dry river channel that may hold potential signs of ancient microscopic life, scientists have said. While in-depth analysis is needed of the sample gathered there by Perseverance, science mission chief Nicky Fox said it was the \"closest we've actually come to discovering ancient life on Mars\". A green glow snapped from Mars marks the first time that an aurora has been observed from the surface of another planet. The rover, which has been roaming Mars since 2021, cannot directly detect life, past or present. Instead, it carries a drill to penetrate rocks and tubes to hold the samples gathered from places judged most suitable for having hosted life billions of years ago. Calling it an \"exciting discovery\", a pair of scientists who were not involved in the study — The SETI Institute's Janice Bishop and the University of Massachusetts Amherst's Mario Parente — told the Associated Press that non-biological processes could be responsible. \"That's part of the reason why we can't go so far as to say, 'A-ha, this is proof positive of life,''' lead researcher Joel Hurowitz of Stony Brook University told The Associated Press. \"All we can say is one of the possible explanations is microbial life, but there could be other ways to make this set of features that we see.\" Either way, Dr Hurowitz said it was the best, most compelling candidate yet in the rover's search for potential signs of long-ago life. It was the 25th sample gathered: the tally is now up to 30. The findings appeared in the journal Nature . \"It would be amazing to be able to demonstrate conclusively that these features were formed by something that was alive on another planet billions of years ago, right?\" Dr Hurowitz said. But even if that is not the case, it is \"a valuable lesson in all of the ways that nature can conspire to fool us\". Collected last summer, the sample is from reddish, clay-rich mudstones in Neretva Vallis, a river channel that once carried water into Jezero Crater. This outcrop of sedimentary rock, known as the Bright Angel formation, was surveyed by Perseverance's scientific instruments before the drill came out. Along with organic carbon, a building block of life, Dr Hurowitz and his team found minuscule specks, dubbed poppy seeds and leopard spots, that were enriched with iron phosphate and iron sulphide. On Earth, these chemical compounds are by-products of microorganisms chomping down on organic matter. \"There is no evidence of microbes on Mars today, but if any had been present on ancient Mars, they too might have reduced sulphate minerals to form sulphides in such a lake at Jezero Crater,\" Dr Bishop and Dr Parente wrote in an accompanying editorial. The samples are awaiting retrieval to Earth — an ambitious plan that is on hold as NASA seeks cheaper, quicker options. Perseverance's hunt for signs of life Perseverance sent this selfie back to Earth in 2024. ( Supplied: NASA ) There is no evidence of present-day life on Mars, but NASA has over the decades sent spacecraft to Mars in search of past watery environments that might have supported life way back when. When Perseverance launched in 2020, NASA expected the samples back on Earth by the early 2030s. But that date slipped into the 2040s as costs swelled to $11 billion, stalling the retrieval effort. Until the samples are transported off of Mars by robotic spacecraft or astronauts, scientists will have to rely on Earthly stand-ins and lab experiments to evaluate the feasibility of ancient Martian life, according to Hurowitz. NASA's acting administrator Sean Duffy said budgets and timing would dictate how best to proceed, and even raised the possibility of sending sophisticated equipment to Mars to analyse the samples on the red planet. \"All options are on the table,\" he said. Ten of the titanium sample tubes gathered by Perseverance were placed on the Martian surface a few years ago as a backup to the rest aboard the rover, all part of NASA's still fuzzy return mission.

            "The Conversation, CC BY-SAIf you’ve been supermarket shopping lately, you might have noticed more foods with big, bold protein claims on black packaging – from powders and bars to yoghurt, bread and even coffee. International surveys show people are shopping for more protein because they think it’ll help their fitness and health. But clever marketing can sway our judgement too. Before your next shop, here’s what you should know about how protein is allowed to be sold to us. And as a food and nutrition scientist, I’ll offer some tips for choosing the best value meat or plant-based protein for every $1 you spend – and no, protein bars aren’t the winner.‘Protein’ vs ‘increased protein’ claimsLet’s start with those “high protein” or “increased protein” claims we’re seeing more of on the shelves. In Australia and New Zealand, there are actually rules and nuances about how and when companies can use those phrases.Under those rules, labelling a product as a “protein” product implies it’s a “source” of protein. That means it has at least 5 grams of protein per serving. “High protein” doesn’t have a specific meaning in the food regulations, but is taken to mean “good source”. Under the rules, a “good source” should have at least 10 grams of protein per serving.Then there is the “increased protein” claim, which means it has at least 25% more protein than the standard version of the same food. If you see a product labelled as a “protein” version, you might assume it has significantly more protein than the standard version. But this might not be the case.Take, for example, a “protein”-branded, black-wrapped cheese: Mini Babybel Protein. It meets the Australian and New Zealand rules of being labelled as a “source” of protein, because it has 5 grams of protein per serving (in this case, in a 20 gram serve of cheese). But what about the original red-wrapped Mini Babybel cheese? That has 4.6g of protein per 20 gram serving.The difference between the original vs “protein” cheese is not even a 10% bump in protein content. Black packaging by designFood marketers use colours to give us signals about what’s in a package.Green signals natural and environmentally friendly, reds and yellows are often linked to energy, and blue goes with coolness and hydration. These days, black is often used as a visual shorthand for products containing protein. But it’s more than that. Research also suggests black conveys high-quality or “premium” products. This makes it the perfect match for foods marketed as “functional” or “performance-boosting”.The ‘health halo’ effectWhen one attribute of a food is seen as positive, it can make us assume the whole product is health-promoting, even if that’s not the case. This is called a “health halo”.For protein, the glow of the protein halo can make us blind to the other attributes of the food, such as added fats or sugars. We might be willing to pay more too.It’s important to know protein deficiency is rare in countries like Australia. You can even have too much protein. How to spend less to get more proteinIf you do have good reason to think you need more protein, here’s how to get better value for your money.Animal-based core foods are nutritionally dense and high-quality protein foods. Meats, fish, poultry, eggs, fish, and cheese will have between 11 to 32 grams of protein per 100 grams.That could give you 60g in a chicken breast, 22g in a can of tuna, 17g in a 170g tub of Greek yoghurt, or 12g in 2 eggs. In the animal foods, chicken is economical, delivering more than 30g of protein for each $1 spent. But you don’t need to eat animal products to get enough protein.In fact, once you factor in costs – and I made the following calculations based on recent supermarket prices – plant-based protein sources become even more attractive. Legumes (such as beans, lentils and soybeans) have about 9g of protein per 100g, which is about half a cup. Legumes are in the range of 20g of protein per dollar spent, which is a similar cost ratio to a protein powder. Nuts, seeds, legumes and oats are all good plant-based options. Towfiqu Barbhuiya/Unsplash, CC BY Nuts and seeds like sunflower seeds can have 7g in one 30g handful. Even one cup of simple frozen peas will provide about 7g of protein.Peanuts at $6 per kilogram supply 42g of protein for each $1 spent. Dry oats, at $3/kg have 13g of protein per 100g (or 5g in a half cup serve), that’s 33g of protein per dollar spent. In contrast, processed protein bars are typically poor value, coming in at between 6-8g of protein per $1 spent, depending on if you buy them in a single serve, or in a box of five bars. Fresh often beats processed on price and proteinPackaged products offer convenience and certainty. But if you rely on convenience, colours and keywords alone, you might not get the best deals or the most nutritious choices. Choosing a variety of fresh and whole foods for your protein will provide a diversity of vitamins and minerals, while reducing risks associated with consuming too much of any one thing. And it can be done without breaking the bank.Emma Beckett has received funding for research or consulting from Mars Foods, Nutrition Research Australia, NHMRC, ARC, AMP Foundation, Kellogg and the University of Newcastle.

Revenue Minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule, who heads the panel, in a statement to media stated that there is an apprehension among OBCs that they may face injustice, \"but this will not happen\". \"Only those with proper Kunbi records will be issued certificates as per the govt resolution. Verification will be done through documents, genealogy, and reports from village committees and the tehsildar\\'s office,\" Bawankule said. The meeting held at Mantralaya in Mumbai was attended by ministers including Chhagan Bhujbal, Ganesh Naik, Sanjay Rathod, Pankaja Munde, Atul Save and Dattatray Bharne, along with officials. Bawankule highlighted that the state\\'s OBC population spans 353 castes, many of whom await their share of Rs3,688 crore in pending funds, including Rs1,200 crore in scholarships. \"These scholarships must be expedited, and facilities such as hostels and office spaces must be arranged,\" he said. Concerns over misuse of documentation were also raised. \"While issuing Kunbi-Maratha certificates, only genuine claims should be considered,\" Bawankule said. Several ministers voiced their stand; Bhujbal questioned the adequacy of funds allocated to OBC welfare and urged the finance department to release them promptly for education and hostels.

Earlier this year, there was a chance only two of four quota spots for junior women would be filled for Team USA at the UCI Road World Championships in Kigali, Rwanda. There was no shortage of talent, only money. Now thanks to the former junior world champion , her crowdfunding campaign has generated $15,111, as of September 9, and will be distributed evenly to four young riders - Lidia Cusack, Liliana Edwards, Alyssa Sarkisov and Alexis Jaramillo. \"It\\'d be a shame if two of the girls have potential and miss out, just because of funding. So that\\'s when I was like, \\'Let\\'s put it out there\\'. Donating my prize money, at least I can fund one junior,\" Jastrab told Cyclingnews about her idea to raise money. \"Then we opened it up [with crowdfunding] and it\\'s up to $15,000. It\\'s encouraging to see.\" This year\\'s Road Worlds, September 21-27, will be hosted on the continent of Africa for the first time. It\\'s a positive for Rwanda in the history books, but also an expensive proposition for many riders from around the world. The Danish cycling federation will not send any junior or under-23 riders because of costs, and will only send elites for road races. \"Megan was aware that a trip to Africa would be particularly expensive and saw an opportunity to help alleviate financial stress for athletes, with a particular interest in supporting the Junior Women,\" a spokesperson for USA Cycling told Cyclingnews . \"The money Megan has raised is being split evenly across the junior women to offset the expenses associated with the trip. It’s a testimony to Megan’s passion and heart for the sport and upcoming generations of cyclists.\" Cusack, who won Druivenkoers-Overijse junior race two week ago, and Edwards, the US junior ITT national champion, will race the 18.3km time trial on September 23. They will be joined in the road race four days later by Sarkisov, the US junior road race national champion, and Jaramillo, the silver medalist at nationals in the road race. Cusack and Sarkisov also finished top 10 for junior women at the 2025 Cyclocross World Championships. Jastrab said she was offered a spot to race Worlds in Switzerland last year, which would have required her to pay a fee and cover her own travel as an elite rider. While she declined the spot because the course was not suited for her, it caused consternation that any level of rider could have dreams dashed to test themselves at the highest level because of dollars and cents, not ability. \"As an organisation, I don\\'t think that USA Cycling has the funding for every category, every discipline, for every trip. So my manager and I, we put together a proposal for a scholarship, that would be in the spring for juniors selected for the spring trip to race Nation\\'s Cups. I wanted to help, as it\\'s their first experience in Europe and allows you to qualify for Worlds,\" Jastrab said as she explained what sparked her to help with the funding of young US riders. \"With a scholarship, it would also come with mentorship, so I would give my time and make it more educational. Then it was delayed and delayed.\" The California native said it was a conversation with USA Cycling\\'s Tanner Putt, director of women\\'s juniors, that turned the spark into a flame, that resulted in the launch of a GoFundMe page, given he said they had four quota spots but could maybe send only two because of costs. She also pledged to donate her own prize money and the bank account received a big bump on Sunday after she finished third overall at the Simac Ladies Tour, with a pair of podiums on early stages in the Netherlands. It was her best result of her career at a stage race. \"I did the Giro and the Tour and came out of the Tour pretty tired. I had a really big training week [prior to Simac] which my body was not responding to, so I raced in Plouay two days before Simac and I was just suffering a lot. I just felt so dead to the world. I was a bit worried starting Simac, and the first stage did not go well,\" she told Cyclingnews from the Netherlands. \"So then to turn it around in the second stage, make the first echelon and then sprint to third, and then in the third stage sprint to second, yeah, it\\'s really crazy.\" She was passed by Elisa Balsamo (Lidl-Trek) for the middle GC spot after the time trial on the fifth day, but finished fifth in the bunch sprint on the final stage to secure third overall. That finish also became the biggest points haul for the Picnic-PostNL team so far this season, 160 in one swoop, delivering big rewards for the team as well as the junior women\\'s fund raising. Jastrab know all too well the importance of opportunities in the early years of the development pathway, earning three junior world titles in 2019, two on the track and one on the road. She also owns 27 national titles across multiple disciplines, and earned a bronze medal at the Tokyo Olympic Games as part of the Team Pursuit squad. At these Road World Championship, Jastrab will be just a fan, and watch on her TV. For next year, she said she\\'d still like to set up a scholarship, and is open to help from sponsors. \"I\\'m excited to watch Worlds. I\\'ll be cheering from afar,\" said Jastrab, who through the process has become even more invested in the outcome of the junior events. \"So I think it\\'s just exciting to see their opportunity. Also to race World Championships, they\\'re with the elites, the U23s, everything, it\\'s exciting to watch.\" Subscribe to Cyclingnews to unlock unlimited access to our coverage of the first-ever UCI Road World Championships on African soil.

Abdulkafi topped the MA in Arabic and received medals for being the best student across all subjects in the programme. Speaking about his journey, Abdulkafi shared that he worked as an Arabic teacher in Yemen before joining Lucknow University to pursue higher studies in Arabic Literature and Oriental Studies. However, due to the ongoing conflict in Yemen, where recent attacks took place, attending the convocation in person was not possible for him. \"Arabic is my mother tongue, so studying the subject in depth felt natural to me, but I wanted to step outside my country to seek new perspectives. Coming to India was one of the best decisions I made, as it gave me both academic guidance and cultural understanding,\" he said. Another international achiever was Kijung Jang from South Korea, who secured a medal in Linguistics. She enrolled at Lucknow University in 2023 after arriving in India during the COVID-19 pandemic with her husband, who started a business here. Formerly a language trainer in South Korea, Jang found her academic calling in linguistics. After completing her course, she will return to South Korea. \"As a language trainer back in South Korea, I thought I already found my path, but Lucknow University helped me rediscover my passion for linguistics.

The Malaysian Youth Mental Health Index 2023 (MyMHI’23) shows that youths use positive coping strategies such as leisure activities, worship and outdoor pursuits, with family support acting as a strong protective factor.“External evidence highlights the need for early, continuous digital education in schools, co-designed with youth to keep it relevant and empowering, especially for vulnerable groups.”She also said youths face rising exposure to suicide-related content online, with studies showing 13.7% were cyberbullying victims, 17.1% engaged in suicidal behaviours and suicide attempts among adolescents climbing to 6.9%, often linked to bullying.She added that the Covid-19 pandemic heightened vulnerability as more young people went online, where social media acted as both a risk and a resource.“Analyses of Malaysian X (formerly Twitter) activity revealed frequent suicide-related posts, ranging from awareness and government criticism to direct expressions of suicidal feelings.“MyMHI’23 also shows youths are highly engaged with social media, with 21.8% feeling upset and 17.1% demotivated when posts failed to attract likes or positive comments. Their mental health is tied to online validation, making them vulnerable when harmful content spreads.”Hamizah said such content circulates quickly through social media, messaging apps and private groups, especially at night, on weekends and during school holidays when teens are most active.It ranges from self-harm and suicide posts to eating disorders, risky behaviour, hate speech and fake news, often stumbled upon unintentionally.“Key stressors such as social expectations, body image and achievement pressures are amplified online. Harmful content on beauty standards, academic struggles and ‘success culture’ thrives, often resurfacing during exam periods or in peer groups that migrate to WhatsApp or Telegram after moderation.”Risks increase with longer screen time, chatting with strangers and a sense of “freedom” online, particularly for youths already under stress. Content is often shared impulsively when it becomes popular or is forwarded by trusted friends.She added that many adolescents communicate suicidal intentions indirectly through diaries, memos or online posts, with about half who die by suicide leaving notes or digital clues, often mistaken for teenage moodiness or academic stress.“Evidence shows youths benefit when parents and peers are equipped to discuss risks and build resilience through trust-based approaches, unlike secretive monitoring that undermines trust.“Keeping young people safe online is not about spying on them. It works better to build trust, teach skills and give them more control.”', 'content': 'PETALING JAYA : Malaysia must boost digital literacy and embed local hotlines into social media platforms to shield youths from rising suicide-related risks, says an expert.

Universiti Teknologi Mara Communication and Media Studies Faculty senior lecturer Dr Hamizah Sahharon said many Malaysians remain unaware of these dangers or how to protect themselves, leaving youths especially vulnerable. She emphasised the need for digital literacy education among young people, parents and teachers as online risks such as cyberbullying, scams, grooming and privacy breaches grow. “To help young people stay safe online, digital literacy programmes must be youth-centred, practical and collaborative. The Malaysian Youth Mental Health Index 2023 (MyMHI’23) shows that youths use positive coping strategies such as leisure activities, worship and outdoor pursuits, with family support acting as a strong protective factor. “External evidence highlights the need for early, continuous digital education in schools, co-designed with youth to keep it relevant and empowering, especially for vulnerable groups.” She also said youths face rising exposure to suicide-related content online, with studies showing 13.7% were cyberbullying victims, 17.1% engaged in suicidal behaviours and suicide attempts among adolescents climbing to 6.9%, often linked to bullying. She added that the Covid-19 pandemic heightened vulnerability as more young people went online, where social media acted as both a risk and a resource. “Analyses of Malaysian X (formerly Twitter) activity revealed frequent suicide-related posts, ranging from awareness and government criticism to direct expressions of suicidal feelings. “MyMHI’23 also shows youths are highly engaged with social media, with 21.8% feeling upset and 17.1% demotivated when posts failed to attract likes or positive comments. Their mental health is tied to online validation, making them vulnerable when harmful content spreads.” Hamizah said such content circulates quickly through social media, messaging apps and private groups, especially at night, on weekends and during school holidays when teens are most active. It ranges from self-harm and suicide posts to eating disorders, risky behaviour, hate speech and fake news, often stumbled upon unintentionally. “Key stressors such as social expectations, body image and achievement pressures are amplified online. Harmful content on beauty standards, academic struggles and ‘success culture’ thrives, often resurfacing during exam periods or in peer groups that migrate to WhatsApp or Telegram after moderation.” Risks increase with longer screen time, chatting with strangers and a sense of “freedom” online, particularly for youths already under stress. Content is often shared impulsively when it becomes popular or is forwarded by trusted friends. She added that many adolescents communicate suicidal intentions indirectly through diaries, memos or online posts, with about half who die by suicide leaving notes or digital clues, often mistaken for teenage moodiness or academic stress. “Evidence shows youths benefit when parents and peers are equipped to discuss risks and build resilience through trust-based approaches, unlike secretive monitoring that undermines trust. “Keeping young people safe online is not about spying on them. It works better to build trust, teach skills and give them more control.”', 'pubDate': '2025-09-11 00:00:53', 'pubDateTZ': 'UTC', 'image_url': 'https://thesun.my/binrepository/julian-christ-0i21xhfgw0e-unsplash_5633441_20250910223832.jpg', 'video_url': None, 'source_id': 'thesun_my', 'source_name': 'Thesun', 'source_priority': 81564, 'source_url': 'https://thesun.my', 'source_icon': 'https://n.bytvi.com/thesun_my.png', 'language': 'english', 'country': ['malaysia'], 'category': ['technology', 'top'], 'sentiment': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'sentiment_stats': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_tag': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_region': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_org': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_summary': \"Malaysia's Dr Hamizah Sahharon calls for enhanced digital literacy to protect youths from online suicide risks, highlighting the need for education on cyberbullying, scams, and privacy breaches.

I also thank God for His mercies. I am getting better. I couldn’t write this column last week and I had neither the motivation nor the presence of mind to do so this week either. But I noticed last night that the 2025 ‘World Suicide Prevention Day’ (10th September every year) passed us by in Nigeria without much awareness about an affliction that takes the lives of several of our citizens almost on daily basis. Meanwhile, Nigeria remains one of the few countries in the world where attempted suicide is still treated as a criminal offence under both Section 327 of the Criminal Code Act and Section 231 of the Penal Code Act. As a reminder of the challenge at hand, I am republishing an abridged version of a column I wrote on the issue six years ago.On that occasion, Ireminded readers of the immortal words of David O. McKay: “The most important of life’s battles is the one we fight daily in the silent chambers of the soul.”Following the death in March 2017 of a medical doctor who jumped headlong into the lagoon off Third Mainland Bridge in Lagos, I argued on this page that because some wounds can easily be covered up, we do not always know what people around us are going through or what action they might take when pushed to the edge. I used a two-minute Youtube clip titled ‘Silent Battles’ to illustrate my point in a piece titled ‘The Silent Battles of Life’. Recent developments in our country indicate that many of our citizens do indeed need help without knowing where to turn. That makes them susceptible to depression, a state that has been described as being surrounded by a thousand people yet feeling completely alone.A 25-year-old graduate of Madonna University returned home from the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) scheme to stab himself to death, following signs of depression which his parents noticed and actually did all they could to help. A night guard at the Ekiti state scholarship board hanged himself with clothing material tied to the railing of a building at the ministry of education, after telling his sister-in-law that he was tired of life. A middle-aged man walked into the premises of Wema Bank in the Sango area of Ibadan, stripped naked, climbed the network mast and jumped to his death. A 400-level student of the Department of English and Literary Studies, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, (UNN) posted a revealing suicide note on his Facebook wall and then drank two bottles of ‘Sniper’ to end it all. Faced with the prospect of being withdrawn from the Niger Delta University, a medical student plunged into a river in Ammasoma, Bayelsa State.From failing examinations to being dumped by a lover to desperation resulting from the biting economic situation or health complications and peer pressure, far too many Nigerians are reaching their breaking point and taking their own lives through various means. And if there is anything that recent tragedies have taught, it is that there are many otherwise normal people who nurse a feeling of emptiness and despair that could in turn trigger what is almost becoming an epidemic in our country. More worrisome is that there is now a body of research that suicide can indeed be contagious with the reported death of one person contributing to such decision by others. In her thesis on this issue, Dr Madelyn Gould puts the blame partly on the media. Even in our country, you see in some publications distasteful photographs of victims dangling on the rope. “Media coverage of suicides has been shown to significantly increase the rate of suicide, and the magnitude of the increase is related to the amount, duration, and prominence of coverage”, said Gould.Suicide of course is not peculiar to Nigeria. It is a global challenge. In the last 45 years, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), suicide rates have increased by 60 percent globally and now a leading cause of death among young people–the group at highest risk in a third of all countries. In the US, according to the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, suicide is the third leading cause of death among people between the age of 15 and 24 while, going by WHO estimates, nearly 30 percent of all suicides worldwide occur in India and China.In South Korea, Japan and the Asia-Pacific region, suicide is also the leading cause of death among young people. In fact, a recent government report says that more Japanese children and teenagers killed themselves between 2016 and 2017 than in any year since 1986. “We’d love to eliminate such tragedies altogether, but the reality is several hundred children are taking their lives (each year),” an education ministry official reportedly said. “It’s important to teach children how to get help as soon as possible ... because it becomes harder and harder to find help once they’re already suffering. The light at the end of the tunnel gets darker and darker until they begin to start seeing the light at the end of the tunnel as death.”The president of the association of psychiatrists of Nigeria, Dr Taiwo Sheikh, recently put the number of psychiatrists in Nigeria at about 250. “We are training psychiatrists, both at the West African College of Physicians and the National Postgraduate Medical College, but three out of every five psychiatrists we produce leave the country for greener pastures. One major thing that is eating the field of mental health is brain drain”, he told PUNCH newspaper which did a detailed report on suicide cases in Nigeria. The implication is that even for those who want to seek help, there may be nowhere to go in a nation that has ‘surplus doctors’. But it is also reassuring that many Nigerians are now speaking out on how those going through any form of stress, personal losses, heartbreak, frustration, grief or experiencing depression can be helped. We need an urgent national conversation on mental ill-health which might be more prevalent than we imagine because the system makes it difficult for people to even acknowledge they have such challenges to avoid stigmatization.The most famous psychiatric hospital in the country is in Aro, Abeokuta, Ogun State. Yet, ‘Aro’ or ‘Aromental’ has for decades been the name with which we tag anybody who may have issues that ordinarily deserve a duty of care. Also, because there is no support system, many cannot optimize their potentials. So, beyond counting the body-bags of suicide victims, we need to de-stigmatize the challenge of mental ill-health.In October 2015, the ‘New York Times’ published a lengthy feature story titled, ‘The Chains of Mental Illness in West Africa’ which speaks to how countries within the sub-region, including Nigeria, maltreat people with mental ill-health. We see it on the streets of major cities in Nigeria where people who ordinarily should be helped are paraded in chains. “Every society struggles to care for people with mental illness. In parts of West Africa, where psychiatry is virtually unknown, the chain is often a last resort for desperate families who cannot control a loved one in the grip of psychosis. Religious retreats, known as prayer camps, set up makeshift psychiatric wards, usually with prayer as the only intervention,” wrote New York Times in the report which also revealed that “at last count, Liberia had just one practicing psychiatrist. Niger had three, Togo four and Benin seven. Sierra Leone had none.” The report also stated: “Surveys, like one by psychiatrists at the University of Ibadan in Nigeria, put the prevalence of schizophrenia, characterized by hallucinations and delusions, at 0.5 to 2.5 percent, roughly the same as the global prevalence. That is at least a million people in countries where chaining is common, like Togo, Ghana and Nigeria.”In contrast to how we deal with mental ill-health, especially in Nigeria, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) last Sunday aired a special programme titled, ‘A Royal Team Talk: Tackling Mental Health’ in which the Duke of Cambridge, Prince Williams had a roundtable discussion on a football field with Thierry Henry, Gareth Southgate, Danny Rose, Jermaine Jenas and Peter Crouch on depression and suicide. “Men are the hardest-to-reach audience on the subject of mental health. Suicide is the biggest killer of young men under the age of 45”, said Prince Williams who also shared his own harrowing experience following the death of his mother, Princess Diana, which he described as a “pain like no other pain”.If there is any lesson from recent tragedies, it is that we should be sensitive in how we respond to the plights of others, even in the social media. Although the concern of Dr Robert Brandt was more about professional colleagues in the field of medicine in his piece, “Silent Battles that cannot be Won Alone”, his admonition is nonetheless useful for us all: “I know from multiple friends who have been in that dark place that healing often starts with finding a person who will listen to them. Spouting advice and saying ‘just get over it’ cures nothing. Be kind and listen, truly listen. It can be the start of the healing process.”The Mentally Aware Nigeria Initiative (MANI) and other similar non-profit organisations can be found online, raising awareness on mental health issues in our country and how people can be helped. But sometimes the choice as to whether to carry on or give up is ours to make. In the difficult times in which we live, it is easy to yield to some dark inner pressure when confronted with problems for which we have no immediate solution. In such moments, we must always remember that life, as one writer aptly captured it, is not about waiting for the storm to pass, “it’s about learning how to dance in the rain.”You can follow me on my X (formerly Twitter) handle, @Olusegunverdictand on www.olusegunadeniyi.comThe post Let’s Talk About Suicides appeared first on THISDAYLIVE.', 'pubDate': '2025-09-10 23:54:00', 'pubDateTZ': 'UTC', 'image_url': 'https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.thisdaylive.com/uploads/Screen-Shot-2022-12-08-at-1.06.19-AM.png', 'video_url': None, 'source_id': 'thisdaylive', 'source_name': 'Thisdaylive', 'source_priority': 40015, 'source_url': 'https://www.thisdaylive.com', 'source_icon': 'https://n.bytvi.com/thisdaylive.png', 'language': 'english', 'country': ['nigeria'], 'category': ['health', 'top'], 'sentiment': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'sentiment_stats': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_tag': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_region': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_org': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_summary': 'Olusegun Adeniyi reflects on his recent health struggles and the importance of suicide awareness in Nigeria, a country where attempted suicide is still a criminal offense.

AI and machine learning tools will help businesses better understand customer preferences, enabling personalized travel experiences. Furthermore, satellite technologies will support sustainable tourism management by providing real-time data to monitor environmental impact and optimize resource usage.CountryTechnologyCategoryDescriptionSourceAustraliaTourism Technology and Innovation RoadmapDigital TransformationDevelopment of AI and satellite connectivity for tourism businesses, focusing on sustainability and service delivery.qld.gov.auAustraliaFirst Nations Digital Inclusion RoadmapDigital InclusionAimed at improving connectivity and digital skills among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.digitalinclusion.gov.auAustraliaDigital Health Strategic VisionHealth TechnologyIntegration of telehealth services, patient portals, and data-driven decision-making to improve healthcare in tourism areas.health.qld.gov.auNew ZealandTourism Growth RoadmapTourism InfrastructureInitiatives to enhance international visitor numbers, regional tourism, and technology-driven tourism infrastructure.mbie.govt.nzNew ZealandE-Bike Charging StationsSustainable TourismInstallation of e-bike charging stations along cycle trails to promote eco-friendly travel and regional tourism.beehive.govt.nzNew ZealandDigital Identity Verification AppTravel ConvenienceA mobile app to verify international digital credentials, simplifying and securing the travel experience.beehive.govt.nzNew ZealandAdvanced Technology PlatformInfrastructure DevelopmentInvestments in cryogenics, superconductors, and materials science to support tourism infrastructure improvements.mbie.govt.nzFirst Nations Digital Inclusion RoadmapAnother pivotal initiative in Australia is the First Nations Digital Inclusion Roadmap, which focuses on promoting digital literacy and inclusion among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. Scheduled for completion by 2026, the roadmap is a significant step toward bridging the digital divide, ensuring that all Australians, regardless of their background or location, can benefit from technological advancements in tourism.This roadmap is part of Australia’s broader efforts to promote regional equality. By increasing access to digital tools and infrastructure, the initiative will empower First Nations communities to engage more fully in the tourism industry. It will provide local tourism operators with the resources to reach a wider audience, contributing to economic growth and fostering cultural exchange.Digital Health Strategic VisionQueensland’s digital health transformation also plays a key role in tourism innovation. The Digital Health Strategic Vision is expected to have a profound impact on travel, particularly in health-conscious tourism. With telehealth services, digital patient portals, and a more connected healthcare system, tourists visiting Queensland will experience improved health services during their travels. This initiative also focuses on making healthcare more accessible to tourists, ensuring that travelers can receive timely medical assistance through digital platforms, enhancing their overall experience in the region.New Zealand’s Smart Tourism and Infrastructure InnovationsTourism Growth RoadmapNew Zealand is equally committed to advancing its tourism sector through technology. The government’s Tourism Growth Roadmap sets a clear direction for the future of the country’s tourism industry. By 2026, New Zealand aims to establish itself as a leader in smart tourism, using innovative technologies to enhance visitor experiences, promote sustainability, and improve infrastructure. This roadmap aligns with the country’s broader goals of fostering inclusive economic growth and ensuring that tourism benefits all regions equally.Key elements of the roadmap include the development of smarter infrastructure systems for tourism hubs, such as smart airports, digital visitor information points, and eco-friendly accommodation options. By incorporating these technologies, New Zealand will offer tourists seamless, sustainable, and more enjoyable experiences. The focus on regional tourism will also help distribute the economic benefits of travel across the country, reducing pressure on traditional tourist hotspots.E-Bike Charging Stations for Sustainable TravelNew Zealand’s commitment to sustainable tourism is highlighted by the introduction of E-Bike Charging Stations along popular cycling trails. These stations are part of a broader strategy to encourage eco-friendly travel, providing tourists with the facilities needed to explore New Zealand’s stunning landscapes using electric bikes. By 2026, the government aims to create a comprehensive network of charging stations, making it easier for travelers to embark on green journeys and enjoy New Zealand’s natural beauty while minimizing their carbon footprint.The project also supports local economies by promoting rural tourism. Cyclists often visit lesser-known towns and regions, helping to boost small businesses and create jobs in these areas. This initiative is a win-win for both the environment and local communities, contributing to New Zealand’s vision of a sustainable tourism model.Digital Identity Verification AppAnother significant technological development in New Zealand is the launch of a Digital Identity Verification App, expected to streamline the visitor experience. This app allows tourists to verify their digital credentials, such as travel documents and health certifications, making it easier and quicker to enter the country. By eliminating the need for physical verification at borders and immigration checkpoints, the app will reduce waiting times, improve efficiency, and enhance the overall travel experience for international visitors.The app’s rollout is part of a larger effort to modernize travel infrastructure, incorporating cutting-edge technologies to facilitate smoother and safer travel for tourists. This development is particularly crucial for New Zealand, given the growing number of international travelers, and will make the country more accessible to tourists from around the world.Advanced Technology for Tourism InfrastructureIn addition to the digital tools mentioned above, New Zealand is investing in advanced technologies such as cryogenics, superconductors, and materials science, which are indirectly benefiting tourism infrastructure. These technologies are being deployed to improve the country’s space, aviation, and clean processing sectors, all of which can contribute to the growth of the tourism industry. For instance, advancements in aerospace technologies could lead to better air travel options for visitors, while clean processing methods may improve environmental sustainability in tourism-related operations.Looking Ahead to 2026: A Future Shaped by TechnologyBoth Australia and New Zealand are committed to using technology to not only enhance the travel experience but also address pressing challenges like sustainability and digital inclusion. By 2026, the tourism landscapes in these countries will be vastly different, with smarter, greener, and more accessible systems that cater to the needs of modern travelers. Whether it’s through AI-powered services, eco-friendly travel options, or more inclusive digital tools, both nations are setting the stage for a future where technology drives tourism forward in exciting new ways.As these technologies come to life, they will not only transform how tourists experience both countries but also help generate economic growth, promote regional development, and create new opportunities for local communities. With such visionary plans in place, Australia and New Zealand are undoubtedly at the forefront of the global tourism technology revolution.The post Australia and New Zealand are Hosting New Groundbreaking Technologies to Reshape their Tourism Sectors in 2026 appeared first on Travel And Tour World.', 'pubDate': '2025-09-10 23:41:58', 'pubDateTZ': 'UTC', 'image_url': 'https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/debika-1.jpeg', 'video_url': None, 'source_id': 'travelandtourworld', 'source_name': 'Travel And Tour World', 'source_priority': 702160, 'source_url': 'https://www.travelandtourworld.com', 'source_icon': 'https://n.bytvi.com/travelandtourworld.png', 'language': 'english', 'country': ['united states of america'], 'category': ['tourism'], 'sentiment': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'sentiment_stats': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_tag': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_region': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_org': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_summary': \"In 2026, Australia and New Zealand will host new technologies to revolutionize their tourism sectors, focusing on digital inclusion, sustainability, and enhanced visitor experiences.

The outreach team was accompanied by Adv Taba Zim, Chairperson of the Child Welfare Committee, who elaborated on the critical role played by the Child Welfare Committee in protecting the rights of children and ensuring their well-being. She emphasised the need for collective action to address child-related rights violations and create an enabling environment for their growth and development. Adding to the programme, Bamang Kaku, Coordinator of Arunachal Citizen Rights, conducted a session on raising awareness about HIV and substance abuse. She highlighted the challenges faced by communities and the importance of sensitizing the public about health-related rights and support systems available to individuals affected by these issues. Joel Angu, Research Officer of APSHRC, provided participants with a detailed account of the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993. He explained the legislative framework and underscored the importance of human rights education in empowering citizens to claim and defend their rights. He further spoke about the proactive role the commission plays in addressing grievances and promoting legal literacy. The official statement emphasized that the programme is being conducted in collaboration with Arunachal Citizen Rights, underscoring the joint effort to enhance human rights awareness at the grassroots level. Through this initiative, APSHRC aims to build stronger networks, encourage dialogue, and equip communities with the knowledge required to uphold human dignity and justice. The three-day programme is expected to reach a wider audience across the district, fostering partnerships and reinforcing the state’s commitment to creating a society that values equality, justice, and respect for human rights.', 'pubDate': '2025-09-10 23:40:00', 'pubDateTZ': 'UTC', 'image_url': 'https://thehillstimes.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/APSHRC-launches-three-day-human-rights-awareness-outreach-programme.jpg', 'video_url': None, 'source_id': 'thehillstimes', 'source_name': 'The Hills Times', 'source_priority': 1284373, 'source_url': 'https://thehillstimes.in', 'source_icon': 'https://n.bytvi.com/thehillstimes.png', 'language': 'english', 'country': ['india'], 'category': ['top', 'politics'], 'sentiment': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'sentiment_stats': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_tag': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_region': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_org': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_summary': \"The Arunachal Pradesh State Human Rights Commission (APSHRC) has initiated a three-day Human Rights Awareness Outreach Programme in Kurung Kumey District, starting at Sangram.

Speaking at a press conference, Country Head, Zoho Nigeria, Mr. Kehinde Ogundare, said: “We continue to invest in Nigeria as businesses here accelerate their adoption of technology to grow and scale. The latest study around AI and Privacy proves that Nigerian businesses are leading the way in responsible AI adoption, as they temper the new technology with privacy measures. This mirrors Zoho’s philosophy of building contextual and privacy-first AI models that can help businesses realise tangible benefits. We infuse our AI solutions—from conversational and prescriptive to agentic and generative—with business context so that it can provide organisations with decision intelligence.”The report, which surveyed 386 respondents in Nigeria, reveals that 93 per cent of Nigerian organisations have already begun their AI journey, with 31 per cent achieving advanced AI integration across the organisation, and 26.5 per cent implementing AI across multiple departments. This indicates that more than half of Nigerian businesses have moved from an experimental phase to operational deployment of AI. Furthermore, 84 per cent of the respondents report strengthening privacy measures since implementing AI, with 66 per cent describing these improvements as significant, the report said.According to the report, the widespread adoption is being driven by executive commitment at the highest levels, as more than half of the respondents occupy CEO or executive roles, and this leadership-driven approach is accelerating adoption and moving companies quickly from pilots to full-scale deployment. The study found that Nigerian businesses are not just adopting AI, they are embedding it responsibly.The report further said 94 per cent of organisations now have a dedicated privacy officer or team, a figure well above global averages. “In fact, 40 per cent of the organisations allocate more than 30 per cent of their IT budgets specifically to privacy protection, reflecting the belief that strong governance is a competitive advantage rather than constraint,” the report further said.The financial sector, according to the report, is pioneering the balance between innovation and compliance, representing 29 per cent of the respondents. Their top AI use cases for them include customer service automation (49 per cent), software development and enhancement (46 per cent), and marketing optimisation (32 per cent), each implemented with privacy-by-design principles at the core. Addressing AI upskilling and barriers, the report said while the lack of technical expertise was cited as the top-most barrier by 37 per cent of the businesses, privacy and security concerns were the next biggest challenge, cited by 35 per cent of the respondents, adding that skills development is, therefore, a defining feature of the Nigerian model, with 69 per cent of organisations prioritising data analysis and interpretation skills, 53 per cent emphasising on AI literacy, and 40 per cent of organisations investing in prompt engineering skills for generative AI tools. The report noted that Nigerian organisations recognised that AI success depends more on human capability development than technology acquisition.

According to the report, the largest investment component of $1.5 trillion to $ 1.7 trillion is required for hard infrastructure, alongside substantial funding for human and institutional capacity, mainly in developing countries.Giving details of the report, ITU Secretary-General, Doreen Bogdan-Martin, said: “Digital connectivity means creating opportunities for education, jobs, and access to essential services that can transform lives and communities. While significant resources are needed to meaningfully connect everyone, these are investments that will contribute to a prosperous digital future for all.”Acting Governor of CST, Haytham AlOhali, said: “The world needs between $ 2.6 trillion and $ 2.8 trillion to connect humanity by 2030. This figure is nearly five times higher than the last assessment conducted in 2020 in partnership with ITU during the Saudi chairmanship of the G20. Such a dramatic increase underscores the urgency for international cooperation, collective investment, and the sharing of expertise if we are to achieve the vision of universal, meaningful connectivity for all.”Highlighting the challenges of connecting billions of people globally, ITU estimates that 2.6 billion people are still excluded from the digital world, with connectivity closely linked to levels of socio-economic development. In 2024, an estimated 93 per cent of the population in high-income countries was using the Internet, compared to just 27 per cent in low-income countries.The new report on achieving universal meaningful connectivity builds on ITU’s original 2020 Connecting Humanity study, published under the direction of the G20 during the presidency of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, by identifying critical gaps with the anticipated costs for addressing them. \\u200bAccording to the report, a breakdown of the $2.8 trillion investment cost, shows that deploying broadband networks such as 4G fixed wireless in rural regions and satellites in the most remote locations and in underserved populations, represents the single largest cost of between $1.5 and $1.7 trillion.Affordability represents $983 billion to reduce the cost of smartphones and broadband services for both fixed and mobile, which according to the report, is vital so that individuals and households worldwide, particularly in lower-income regions, can afford to connect and stay online.Digital skills represents $152 billion to boost the effective use of the Internet, since connectivity alone is not enough, as people must have the skills to use the Internet effectively. Investments to fund large-scale digital literacy initiatives can empower individuals to access online education, secure better jobs, and actively participate in a digitally-driven society, the report said.Policy and regulation represents $ 600 million to modernise regulations and create predictable policy environments worldwide, that will unlock efficiencies and promote innovation. While this represents the smallest cost component, it holds back digital transformation and sustains the other gaps. The impact of closing it would be massive, according to the report.The report however said public-private collaboration would be needed to achieve the five-year investment plan on global Internet connectivity.As the ‘Connecting Humanity Action Blueprint’ highlights, global progress on connectivity has been uneven, with the world’s 46 least-developed countries lagging significantly due to financing barriers, limited technical expertise, and unreliable infrastructure.To address the challenges, ITU has called for innovative business approaches and renewed collaboration between governments, the tech industry, development finance institutions, and civil society, to close current divides and prevent future ones, particularly in fields like Artificial Intelligence (AI).The report recommended the use of schools as gateways to Internet access to accelerate digital inclusion worldwide, including investing in energy infrastructure in Africa, and enhancing data collection at the sub-national level.The post Report: Achieving Global Internet Connectivity by 2030 Will Require $2.8trn Investment appeared first on THISDAYLIVE.', 'pubDate': '2025-09-10 23:37:00', 'pubDateTZ': 'UTC', 'image_url': 'https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.thisdaylive.com/uploads/0-944.jpg', 'video_url': None, 'source_id': 'thisdaylive', 'source_name': 'Thisdaylive', 'source_priority': 40015, 'source_url': 'https://www.thisdaylive.com', 'source_icon': 'https://n.bytvi.com/thisdaylive.png', 'language': 'english', 'country': ['nigeria'], 'category': ['technology', 'top'], 'sentiment': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'sentiment_stats': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_tag': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_region': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_org': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_summary': \"The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) estimates that achieving global internet connectivity by 2030 will require an investment of $2.6 to $2.8 trillion.

It provided suffrage rights to women based on literacy, property ownership or marriage to propertied men. It also granted forty-one reserved seats for women in the provincial legislatures, as well as limited reservations for them in the central legislature. There were two assembly seats from Pune city, with one reserved for women. The Congress party nominated Bhalchandra Maheshwar Gupte, a prominent lawyer, and Lakshmibai Thuse for these seats. The Lokshahi Swarajya Party had stood up to fight the Congress with Lakshmanrao Bhopatkar and Subhadrabai Tarkunde, both lawyers, as its candidates. The party comprised members from the so-called “Kesari” faction and those with allegiance to the Hindu Mahasabha. The contest was closely fought and both parties were criticised by many for their unsavoury behaviour during the poll campaign, with the Marathi newspaper “Dnyanaprakash” calling it a disgrace for the city. Keshavrao Jedhe, Narhar Vishnu Gadgil, and Gajanan Narayan Kanitakar, the Congress leaders, were called out for their speeches that were allegedly “casteist” and “anti-Brahmin”. Stones were pelted at campaign meetings held by Bhopatkar and Tarkunde. However, a greater controversy arose when Thuse was ridiculed based on her election symbol – the portable stone hand-mill. Grains like wheat, jowar, or bajra were ground for daily use in a portable hand-mill. Two circular stones were roughened on the corresponding surfaces, and laid one upon the other, a fixed pin in the lower stone passing loosely through the upper as an axis. The grain was put into the mill through an opening near the centre in the upper stone, which was turned by a handle fastened near its edge. The grain, when it had been broken or ground by the action and weight of the stone, was thrown out at the edges and caught in the receptacle in which the mill was placed. One of the first morning duties of the women in the North-west and Central India was to grind the corn required for the use of the family. The flour was made into flat loaves of bhakari or chapati. Born in Khopoli, Thuse was widowed at the age of eleven. Later, she went to Indore to study midwifery and worked as a nurse in Mumbai. But she, and her election symbol, were considered unworthy of representation in the legislative assembly by her opponents. For them, the hand-mill was worthless and mundane, just like the principle of non-violence that they abhorred. Bhopatkar and Tarkunde were contesting with the symbol of a roaring tiger. One of the leading Marathi newspapers in Pune, which espoused the Hindu nationalist cause, compared both the election symbols and advised Thuse to stay put in her kitchen. As a child widow, Thuse was not supposed to assert any power. She was to work in the kitchen and be submissive. Her profession was considered lowly. Her detractors also called her “ugly”. She did not fit their perception of an “ideal Indian woman”. Tarkunde, practising law since 1933, was then the only woman advocate of Pune. She had been appointed as the municipal pleader by the Poona City Municipality. She was married to Balkrishna M Tarkunde, who had studied at Oxford University and was also a lawyer. With his encouragement, she had cleared the advocate’s examination after their marriage. The “Dnyanaprakash”, usually mildly critical of the Hindu nationalists, extended its support to Tarkunde. “Pune needs someone better educated, someone who can argue in the legislative assembly as its representative; a midwife with a hand-mill as her symbol is hardly a worthy candidate”, it wrote on multiple occasions before the elections. It ignored Thuse’s socio-political contributions. Thuse had participated in the Home Rule Movement and contributed actively to the “Swarajya Fund”. She was a member of the Provincial Harijan Sevak Sangh and regularly visited the so-called “harijan bastis” to attend to ailing women and children. During the Civil Disobedience Movement of 1930, she was the “dictator” of the party in Pune for three months during which female satyagrahis picketed shops selling toddy and foreign goods, and endured lathi-charges. She organised volunteers to provide food and water to those protesting against the Raj. She took care of the wounded. More than a hundred women, including her, were imprisoned for six months during the Movement. She was a devoted follower of Mahatma Gandhi, who encouraged women to step out of their houses to participate in the independence struggle. Gandhi’s appeal to join the Congress garnered an amazing response. One moment, the women were confined to their homes, and the next, they were out on the streets picketing against toddy shops. Gandhi’s belief that the wife was the husband’s “comrade, his better half, colleague, and friend” drew criticism from conservative quarters. They were worried that women’s emancipation would erode their power base and shake the traditional patriarchal power they had over them. With the rise of the middle class in nineteenth-century Maharashtra, strong ideologies emerged on domesticity that borrowed Victorian ideals and revolved around the home, marriage, and motherhood. They created a clear division between the public and private spheres, with the home seen as a haven for peace, stability, virtue, and piety, which was to be held together by the woman by moral and emotional bonds. The Hindu nationalists supported limited emancipation of women in the twentieth century to aid the cause of a Hindu nation that was “strong” and “masculine”. Women were supposed to earn an education, participate in sports and physical education programmes, and practice religion so that they could give birth to “healthy, intelligent, and strong” children who would serve the society and the nation. Education for women was endorsed as a tool to enhance women’s social presence and make them more responsible towards their familial duties. Women were supposed to inculcate the virtues of cleanliness, companionship, discipline, and self-control through education and add to their traditional roles in the families, without challenging patriarchy. During the campaign, large posters of a hand-mill were put up in the city and at the Congress polling offices on the election day. People would shout - “We don’t want a hand-miller’s politics! Maharashtra is a tiger’s cub, and we need that spirit and attitude!” Congress workers would reply – “No one can work on an empty stomach. We have to buy grain and grind it to make flour, and for that, we need the hand-mill’. Thuse won the election by 3,702 votes. In 1937, eighty women were elected to legislative assemblies. India then had the third-highest number of female legislators in the world after the US and the Soviet Union. Thuse was elected to the State Legislative Assembly a couple of times more and contributed to the socio-political sector till her death. Tarkunde was elected as the president of the Pune Bar Association in 1966, perhaps the first Indian woman to grace the presidency of a bar association. She was also the first Indian woman to become president of the Debt Relief Fund. The burden of representing the inner or spiritual realm of the nation, however, is still delegated to the constructed image of the “modern Indian woman” who belongs to the so-called “upper caste” and upper class, is educated and religious, yet not “western”.

The discourse is critical at this time as the abuse of the awards has become alarming, and while other African countries in the least are addressing the subject, the relevant organs in Nigeria appear to be indifferent for reasons best known to them. The situation is becoming so deplorable that it is best captured in the Yoruba proverb that “Ti a ba fun ni niyì, ki a ma fi owo Ewa je E niyì”, when honor is bestowed upon us, we must not devalue it by our own hands. This timeless saying captures the essence of our conversation today. Honorary degrees are one of the highest honors that universities can bestow. Yet, in our country today, this once hallowed tradition has become entangled in the murky waters of politics, patronage, and commercial interests. Alausa, Education Minister The need for reform could not be more urgent than now. If for nothing, let us emulate some other progressive countries in this regard. The tradition of honorary degrees, as inherited from ancient European universities, was designed to honor men and women whose works exemplified the finest ideals of humanity, those that are great thinkers, nation-builders, philanthropists, and those who, through service, had elevated society. Early Nigerian universities embraced this tradition with care and circumspection. At the University of Ibadan in its early decades, to be awarded an honorary degree was almost akin to canonization. Recipients were statesmen of unblemished character, towering academics, and icons of culture. The honorary degrees were symbolic and bereft of any academic rigour or scholarship. But fast-forward to today, and one observes a worrying trend. Honorary degrees have become tools of sycophancy, instruments of political signaling, and, in the worst cases, commodities for sale. Some universities, desperate for funds or relevance, have turned this noble recognition into a transactional affair. When individuals facing corruption trials or leaders with dubious records are garlanded with academic honors, the institution itself loses moral authority. The scenario is now turning out to be that from glory to controversy. Let us contextualize this with scenarios. Suppose the University of Lagos decides to honor an innovator who designed affordable solar technology for rural electrification. The award not only uplifts that individual but also signals to students and the nation that innovation is valued. Conversely, when a university confers an honorary degree on a controversial billionaire whose wealth source is opaque, the signal is that “anything goes.” Another scenario. Imagine Lagos State University choosing to honor a LASTMA officer who, over decades, distinguished himself in managing traffic with integrity and courage. Such a gesture would remind the public that true honor lies in service, not just in status. We cannot ignore the increasing politicization of honorary degrees. It has become common practice for universities to award serving governors, ministers, or legislators, often during their tenure, and frequently in anticipation of material favors in numerous ways such as in form of donations, endowments, or state allocations. This practice undermines the autonomy of the university and sends the wrong signal to students. How can a student believe in meritocracy when his university glorifies individuals whose legacies remain under question? Another albatross is that of the commercialization of the honors. In some quarters, the rumor, sometimes substantiated, is that honorary degrees are for sale. Business moguls, social celebrities, and even entertainers with questionable lifestyles suddenly parade themselves as “Doctor” this and “Doctor” that. Such commercialization is nothing short of an assault on academic integrity. Ordinarily, this ought to be a source of worry to the academic community but strangely, they seem to be totally indifferent and non-challant. The question is, are they not worried about the reputation of their institutions? When a university chooses to honor someone later convicted of fraud or corruption, the shame is not on the individual alone, it is obviously a stain on the entire institution. The university, as a custodian of truth and excellence, ought and must avoid such reputational risks. The attitude, however, as I opined above, is lackadaisical. The implication of this practice is the marginalization of the true heroes deserving of the honors. Countless Nigerians who deserve recognition, scientists working silently on life-saving research, community leaders transforming local lives, teachers shaping generations, and social reformers sacrificing personal comfort for public good, who truly merit the honors are overlooked. In most instances, the basis of denial is simply because they lack political power or deep pockets to connect them. This is not only injustice disguised as tradition but academic hara-kiri. The situation has degenerated so badly that the honors are not only largely valueless now but even threaten real and earned academic degrees as unveiled below. Except the system promptly responds to the challenge, there might be nothing to rescue again in due course. How does this system achieve this, I believe the basic route is the regulation of the process. Some may argue that regulation would infringe upon university autonomy. On the contrary, regulation would protect it. Autonomy without accountability is a recipe for abuse. By instituting a framework for honorary awards, Nigeria would not be curtailing freedom but safeguarding dignity. Regulation ensures consistency, fairness, and transparency. More importantly, it repositions honorary degrees as instruments of inspiration for our youth. This is imperative to curtail the ongoing abuse; and this approach is not going to be peculiar to Nigeria nor novel. Just recently in Ethiopia, the Ministry of Education issued directives barring serving government officials and political candidates from being nominated for honorary degrees. Full-time employees, members of the senate of the university or administrative staff of the institutions, unless their direct relationship with the institution has ended, are equally prohibited. The directive went further to restrict newly established universities from conferring the distinction, mandating them that to be able to make such awards, the institutions must have graduated at least eight cohorts of students and offer degrees such as PhDs, to qualify. Most significantly, in the determination of entitlements, the institutions are made to be under compulsion to ensure compliance with both national and international standards. My position is even simpler and much relaxed than this. It is that the minimum guidelines be set by the stakeholders and must be uniform while making compliance compulsory, with the attendant sanction in any case of violation. The failure to arrest the drift would ultimately amount to what Fela Anikulapo-Kuti once sang, “Teacher, don’t teach me nonsense.” If universities continue to elevate questionable characters, they indirectly teach students that character is dispensable so long as one has power or wealth. This essentially connotes the concept of teaching nonsense. Arising from the submission above, it will be expected that the National Universities Commission (NUC), working with the Committee of Pro- and Vice-Chancellors, produces a standardized framework. The framework must specify criteria for the conferment of the honor and it must, as of necessity, include:Demonstrable contributions to human knowledge, culture, or innovation; Evidence of service to humanity or significant community development; Proven ethical integrity and a clean record without any known pending corruption cases or convictions. This national benchmark would ensure uniformity across institutions. In the implementation of the framework, the Universities will establish independent vetting committees. This committee that every university would establish will constitute the honorary awards committee and must be insulated from political or financial influence. The committee must include respected academics, alumni, and perhaps even external referees of high moral standing. Their task would be to screen nominees carefully, assess their track records, and submit recommendations to the university senate. Ordinarily, I would have suggested the inclusion of the officials of the anti-corruption bodies but these days, there are challenges in that sector also. I therefore will only counsel the procurement of input from them. To guarantee transparency and public scrutiny, the universities will then publish their list of nominees ahead of convocation ceremonies, allowing room for objections or commendations from the public. Public accountability will ensure that controversial figures do not slip through the cracks. As unveiled above in Ethiopia, Serving politicians are barred from such awards. The framework must insist that honorary degrees should not be conferred on serving political office holders. A cooling-off period of at least five years after leaving office should apply. This ensures that society has had time to evaluate their legacies objectively. As proffered above, there must be sanctions accompanying the resolutions. Universities that flout the guidelines should face sanctions. The NUC could suspend their right to award honorary degrees for a specified number of years at the barest minimum while possibly criminalizing the abuse. This deterrent would discourage abuse. The import of applying the antidote will now be the unveiling of the unsung heroes. Institutions will then be encouraged to honor innovators, cultural icons, teachers, scientists, and social workers who represent true merit. By spotlighting these unsung heroes, universities would inspire the youth to believe that character and contribution matter more than wealth or power. This will also lead to the restoration of the integrity of the awarding institutions. In addition, the Regulation would restore dignity to tertiary institutions. A university’s worth is not only in its infrastructure but in its reputation. When a university confers honors only on individuals of proven merit, it builds credibility both nationally and globally. This will also be a source of inspiration to the students. Imagine the inspiration a student feels when her university confers an honorary degree on a Nobel Laureate, a community health worker who saved thousands during an epidemic, or a teacher who dedicated 40 years to molding minds. That is the power of symbolism. The adoption of such unified framework that is the product of the stakeholders will boost the autonomy of the institutions. No entity or individual can then dictate to the university. Ironically, this implies that, by establishing such clear national guidelines, the universities gain protection and is insulated against political pressure. A Vice-Chancellor can politely decline political lobbying by pointing to national policy. The further implication of this is the restoration of the battered national image. On the international stage, Nigerian universities would command greater respect. Currently, the credibility of our honorary degrees is questioned abroad because of the loose and inconsistent practices at home. The Regulation would reposition our institutions as serious custodians of knowledge and values. Globally, universities have withdrawn honorary degrees when recipients were later found wanting. Harvard University withdrew its honorary degree from Harvey Weinstein after his conviction. This shows that institutions must protect their reputations even retrospectively. Nigerian universities must be courageous enough to do the same. Again, Ghana Tertiary Education Commission recently deprecated the indiscriminate use honorary degrees. Ghana raised the alarm over the rise of so-called “degree mills”, dubious institutions awarding the honors for fees. The Commission has risen up to the challenge of the surge in the number of individuals falsely parading and identifying themselves as academic doctors or professors. This is basically targeted at the misuse of the titles. Just as Ethiopia did, Ghana also frowns at the increasing public use of honorary titles, particularly by politicians, religious leaders and business figures describing such as “deceitful and unethical”, warning that it erodes the value of genuine academic achievement. To this end, the countries have banned the use of honorific academic titles in the public, outside the awarding institution, in order to preserve the integrity of the academic degrees. In rounding up, let me acknowledge the recent petition of a Coalition of Academics and Professors for Qualified Use of Academic titles (CAPQAT) led by one Prof. Adeyemi Jonhson Ademowo to the various regulators decrying the increasing abuse of the academic titles. I salute the group. The fact remains that honorary degrees are not mere ornaments; they are symbols of the values we cherish as a society. In their current unregulated state in Nigeria, they risk becoming tools of ridicule rather than instruments of honor. As a Yoruba proverb teaches us: “Orúko rere sàn ju wúrà àti fàdákà”, a good name is better than gold or silver. Let us, therefore, insist that our universities bestow their highest honors only on those whose names enhance, rather than diminish the prestige of the academy. Regulation is not the enemy of autonomy; it is its safeguard. It is the compass that will guide our institutions back to dignity. By instituting national guidelines, independent vetting, public scrutiny, restrictions on serving politicians, and sanctions for abuse, we can restore trust in our tertiary institutions. Let the recipients of tomorrow’s honorary degrees be individuals whose lives teach our children that merit, service and integrity are the true measures of honor. Only then can we say, with clear conscience, that our universities remain citadels of learning, not marketplaces of favors. Let us not relegate the honorific degrees to the debased level that the award of National Honors is now assuming.

Emma Okonji presents the excerpts: After three years of CVA, how would you assess the concept and consumer participation?The Consumers Value Awards has grown significantly over the last three editions. What started as a vision to give consumers a voice in rewarding value-driven brands has now become a national movement. Participation has risen steadily each year, both in terms of brands listed and consumers engaging in the voting process. We’ve seen consumers actively campaigning for their preferred brands, which show the level of ownership and belief in the process. For us, that validates the concept — consumers want to be heard, and CVA is a credible platform for that.How are companies reacting to the results of CVA so far?Companies are paying close attention. Many see the recognition not just as an award but as an endorsement by the consumer. For some brands, it has become a badge of honour that they proudly showcase in their marketing. Look at globacom when they won the award two years ago with the massive publicity on it, you can also see Checkers Custard, Waw detergent and Reload Multivitamin publicities on winning the award to mention those and even Leadway Insurance conversation on their first win of the award.Overall, the response has been positive and constructive, with brands appreciating that the results reflect genuine consumer perception.Are there specific examples of how companies are using the CVA result to adjust their product and service offerings?We are yet to have any of such information, however, we do have conversations with winners and nominated brands requesting for backend data and I think smart marketing teams will use that amongst other data available to them to interrogate the brands. We don’t want to claim what we have not experienced but truth be told, what CVA provide is a subtle strong valuation opportunity for brands as influencer of brand marketing and product development initiative.What informed the introduction of government agencies into the programme this year?Government agencies are major service providers, and in many cases, consumers interact with them more than private brands. We realized that empowering consumers to vote on their experiences with public service agencies creates accountability, transparency, and pressure to improve. It also provides the agencies themselves with valuable feedback they may not ordinarily receive in formal reports. Including them makes CVA a more holistic reflection of consumer experiences. Let also add that our goal is not political but pure better service experience for us all as consumers of government servicesHow would the companies so voted ensure the credibility of the voting by the public?The credibility of CVA lies in the transparency of our voting process. It is an open, digital system where consumers directly cast their votes without interference. We don’t collect money from companies to influence results, and we publish the entire process for accountability. For the companies, their responsibility is to continue to earn consumer trust so that votes reflect authentic satisfaction rather than short-term hype. Ultimately, credibility is maintained because it is the people themselves who decide. To cast your vote, you will get an OTP in your inbox or Spam. Just take the four digit PIN and put in the dialogue box. The email address is validated to vote across all the categories.Is CVA a feedback mechanism on perception and feelings by consumers of product offerings and satisfaction?Absolutely, CVA is more than an award — it is a consumer perception index. It captures how consumers feel about the value they are receiving in exchange for their money, time, and loyalty. The results highlight satisfaction levels, service gaps, and areas where brands are excelling. That’s why it is such a powerful feedback tool for companies, because it reflects the true voice of the marketplace.Is this a pro bono service to companies to understand where they are in the face of consumers?Yes, the voting and recognition process is entirely pro bono. Brands do not pay to be listed or to be voted for — the awards are earned strictly on merit through consumer votes. Our role is to provide the platform and ensure credibility. This makes CVA unique because it levels the playing field: whether you are a multinational, a local brand, or even a government agency, the only factor that counts is the consumer’s voice. That neutrality is what gives CVA its strength and integrity.What makes the Consumers Value Awards different from other industry awards?The difference is simple — CVA is powered entirely by consumers. Many industry awards are judged by panels or influenced by sponsorships, but CVA is strictly based on the votes of everyday consumers. This makes it the most democratic and transparent recognition platform in the country as at this moment. When a brand wins, it is because the people have spoken. That consumer-driven model is what sets us apart.How do you ensure that rural and less tech-savvy consumers are represented in the voting process?Inclusivity is central to our mission. We know that consumer experiences go beyond urban centers and smartphone users. That’s why we have invested in communication campaigns such as this and others. Our mobile-friendly voting portal is lightweight and works well even on basic devices. Over time, we’re exploring offline support systems to give more consumers, regardless of literacy or technology access, a chance to participate.What is the long-term vision for CVA?Our vision is to make CVA the benchmark for consumer trust and value in the country and eventually across Africa. We want companies and agencies to see it as an annual report card directly from the people they serve. Beyond the awards, we plan to release periodic consumer insights, deepen engagement, and create a knowledge base that shapes policy, innovation, and service delivery. Ultimately, the goal is for CVA to become the go-to reference for measuring consumer satisfaction in the country.The post Ekine: Brand Perception Will Improve Quality of Products appeared first on THISDAYLIVE.', 'pubDate': '2025-09-10 23:27:00', 'pubDateTZ': 'UTC', 'image_url': 'https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.thisdaylive.com/uploads/0-1-275.jpg', 'video_url': None, 'source_id': 'thisdaylive', 'source_name': 'Thisdaylive', 'source_priority': 40015, 'source_url': 'https://www.thisdaylive.com', 'source_icon': 'https://n.bytvi.com/thisdaylive.png', 'language': 'english', 'country': ['nigeria'], 'category': ['lifestyle', 'top', 'business'], 'sentiment': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'sentiment_stats': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_tag': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_region': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_org': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_summary': \"Mr. Akonte Ekine, Convener of the Consumers Value Awards (CVA), discusses the initiative's impact on brand perception and consumer engagement over the past three years.

It will create a collaborative platform for discussion, deliberation, and shaping the way forward in preserving, digitising, and sharing India’s manuscript heritage with the world. The ‘Gyan Bharatam’ will be launched as a visionary national movement dedicated to safeguarding and disseminating India’s vast manuscript wealth. It will serve both as a tribute to the nation’s civilisational roots and as a forward-looking step towards the Prime Minister’s vision of a Viksit Bharat by 2047, where India emerges as a true Vishwa Guru, combining the wisdom of its past with the innovation of its future. Designed as a comprehensive framework, ‘Gyan Bharatam’ will revive India’s manuscript legacy by combining preservation, digitisation, scholarship, and global accessibility. Its objectives include identification and documentation through a nationwide register, conservation and restoration of fragile texts, large-scale digitisation using AI-driven tools, and creation of a National Digital Repository. It will also focus on research, translation, and publication of rare manuscripts, capacity building for scholars and conservators, development of digital platforms, and public participation through collaborative programmes. Further, global partnerships and the integration of manuscript wisdom into education will strengthen India’s role in global knowledge exchange. Vivek Agarwal, Secretary Culture, in his briefing on the ‘Gyan Bharatam’ stated that the initiative, announced by the Prime Minister, is a major scheme for preserving India’s manuscript heritage. The Mission will undertake a nationwide survey and cataloguing of manuscripts, creation of a digital repository, and develop mechanisms to extract and disseminate the vast knowledge preserved in them, covering subjects ranging from science and medicine to literature, religion, and spirituality. He highlighted that ‘Gyan Bharatam’ will be implemented through a broad alliance of stakeholders, including libraries, religious institutions, and private custodians, ensuring manuscripts are preserved and made accessible for generations to come. Speaking on the ‘Gyan Bharatam’ International Conference, he noted that the three-day gathering will see the participation of more than 1,100 delegates, with deliberations across eight working groups on areas such as script decipherment, documentation, digitisation, conservation, and legal frameworks. Emphasising the role of technology, Agarwal informed that the Gyan-Setu AI innovation challenge has already received over 40 entries, with shortlisted innovations to be presented during the conference.

In Nepal, it took a mass character in just two days, the trigger being the killing of 19 demonstrators by the police on the first day itself. The death toll has by now reached 25. Further, the anger of the students were of a violent nature burning the offices of all established political parties including the three communist parties and the Nepali Congress. Significantly, in Nepal, both in Kathmandu and the two/three other cities, the school students took part in a big way, especially the girls, many of them belonging to the elite families.That way, the revolt in Nepal is the revolt of the Instagram, Facebook generation who are completely in a different mindset compared to the ruling elite including the communists. Both the communist parties of Nepal have a strong students organization but they were completely neutralized in the latest uprising as the generation Z revolted as a whole against the official ban on the 26 social media platforms. In fact this ban was the prime reason for the revolt as the generation Z in Nepal are totally enmeshed in their social media life and any interference by the elders in the family or the government, they are not in a mood to tolerate.The issue of corruption and unemployment came to the focus later when the killing of the movement participants gave a completely new dimension to the revolt by turning it into a movement against the government and the political system as a whole. That was why on the second day on September 9, many seniors joined and the generation Z movement took the character of a national movement. Out of the 2.96 crore population of Nepal, 1.17 crore are below 35 and the age group of 15-24 has 57.6 lakh. This group grew up with insta and facebook and they are the main drivers of the September uprising in Nepal.If we look at the turbulent politics and economy of Nepal in the last ten years, it will be seen that Nepal has not done too bad in terms of its economic development. Its growth rate has been at the level of 6 per cent in 2025. Though one in five young persons is unemployed, this unemployment issue did never emerge as a big one. Nepalese youth always look for jobs outside. On an average 4 lakh Nepalese leave for jobs outside every year. Similarly, Nepal gets huge remittances from outside and that along with earnings from tourism help the economic growth of the country.According to World Bank data, Nepal’s fiscal indicators are thriving. It remains the country that pays the highest duties on vehicles, similar to Singapore, and has the highest tax-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratio in South Asia. Social indicators have dramatically improved, with life expectancy moving from 54.77 years in 1990 to nearly 72 years in 2024. Primary school enrolment is close to a hundred per cent, and the literacy rate has increased from 59 per cent in 2000 to 76 per cent in 2024. Poverty has reduced from 25.16 per cent in 2011 to 20.27 per cent in 2023 as per the Nepal Living Standard Survey 2022/23. Remarkably, 81 per cent of Nepalis live in their own homes, and four out of five Nepali families have at least someone working or living abroad. The population has increased by 10 million between 1991 and 2021 – a 50-per cent increase in over three decades.But the political management of the country has come under sharp criticism in the last ten years of rule by the established political parties in Nepal. In this period, the ruling power was limited to three/four political leaders and their families and friends prospered giving the impression of all round corruption. Among the school students, the nepokids discussion became common. The September movement by the school students was also a sort of expression of their wrath against the nepo kids meaning the children of the ruling families.Three familiar political leaders – K P Sharma Oli, Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ and Sher Bahadur Deuba – have been playing the game of musical chairs. Oli of the Communist Party (CPN) of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) has been able to stay at the helm, splitting and uniting the communist parties. He has become prime minister for the third time at the age of 72 years. He has managed to sideline his two key opponents within his party by pushing them to split and forming a new party. He continues to expel people who confront him.Dahal ‘Prachanda’ rose to prominence leading a violent insurgency. He became prime minister for the first time in 2008, winning the highest number of seats for the CPN (Maoist Centre) in the constituent assembly. He became prime minister twice after that. The 70-year-old Dahal has been part of different coalitions and is accused of proliferating his family’s involvement in a dynastic manner. He is a big manipulator and manages to stay at the top.Deuba, the oldest of the trio, is 79 years. He has become the prime minister five times. A shrewd politician, he knows how to look after his family’s interests. He split with the Nepali Congress to start his faction and then reunited to lead the party since 2016. He pushed his opponent, Ram Chandra Paudel, to become the President and kept the Koirala clan at bay by playing different family factions against one another. He has no political scruples. He can align with anyone to get the highest position.The turmoil in Nepal is still on. The Nepalese army chief and also the President of the country are trying to ease tensions and hold negotiations with the student agitators. The demonstrators have no ready programme. They are only talking of fight against corruption and the political parties. Next few days will show how the next course of politics moves in Nepal. Much will depend on the negotiating capability of the army chief and the President. The leading politicians have lost the trust of the students as also the people.

Her youngest, Noah, was no exception earlier this year. After blowing out his candles, Noah answered his mom’s annual question: “I just wish I could read. I just wish I could read.” Medford recounted her son’s difficulties during a Fort Worth City Council meeting Tuesday. She was joined by several other parents and advocates who praised a summer dyslexia screening program called Literacy Roundup . About half of students living in Fort Worth cannot read proficiently , according to a Fort Worth Education Partnership analysis. The program, a partnership between the city and the Sid W. Richardson Foundation, determined Noah was dyslexic and empowered Medford to ask the right questions at his school so he can receive the help he deserves, his mother said. Noah was one of about 400 children who the Literacy Roundup helped, said Caroline James, who led the effort. Besides screenings, the program connected families with volunteers to guide them to receive services from their schools.

Two of Noah’s brothers were previously diagnosed with the learning disorder. Noah started school in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. At home, the problems were apparent to his mom. She asked the teachers at his private school what was happening and they pinned it on the pandemic, the fact he was just slow, that he’s a boy and asserted he’d pick up soon, she said. But he didn’t. Noah had to repeat the second grade, Medford said. At the end, the private school told her it did not have the resources to properly support Noah. During Noah’s first week of third grade at Como Elementary, Medford met with his teachers and went over her concerns. He can’t sound out words. He’s twisting letters. His brothers are dyslexic. Medford ran into similar excuses, she said. He was moved along in third, fourth and fifth grades. James, the Literacy Roundup leader, screened Noah at Como Community Center. She estimated he was reading on a second-grade level. “The problem is he knows it,” James said. His mom sees the impact every day. “Noah’s very prideful,” Medford said. “He understands that he’s behind all of his classmates.” Medford was grateful that Literacy Roundup gave her family a tangible action plan to help Noah. Thousands of students have yet to receive similar help, advocates said. Medford still faces the same barriers and comments she’s encountered every year, she said. She’s hopeful Noah’s wish will come true soon. Disclosure: The Sid W. Richardson Foundation has been a financial supporter of the Fort Worth Report.

When Gayton was a child, his mother read to him and his siblings from Harriet Beecher Stowe’s account, “The Key to Uncle Tom’s Cabin. ” The author pointed out that Clarke, who had escaped enslavement in Kentucky, was the prototype for her character George Harris in her novel “Uncle Tom’s Cabin.” Gayton first thought that Clarke’s history was simply a story shared within his family. But as he grew older, he learned much more from a distant cousin, historians and his own research. Clarke had been a conductor on the Underground Railroad and later a national figure who traveled the North speaking out against slavery. Clarke’s memoir was the first work by a former slave to be acquired by the Library of Congress and copyrighted. “It’s kind of otherworldly,” Gayton says, adding that throughout his life, his great-grandfather has been both a presence and an inspiration. In exploring more of Clarke’s life, Gayton realized he needed to share his own story for future generations. “ Carver Clark Gayton: Odyssey of a Seattle Native Son ” was published this spring by University of Washington Press. Born in Seattle into a large, heritage-rich family, Gayton has a lineage that runs deep in the Pacific Northwest. His paternal grandfather, for example, was a civic pioneer who arrived in the city in 1889, became a respected local leader who founded several Black community organizations and served as the region’s U.S. District Court librarian. Gayton followed in those successful footsteps. He thrived at Garfield High School, earning All-State honors in football and serving as class president. He attended the University of Washington on a football scholarship and played in the 1960 Rose Bowl. But his journey through the UW would be about much more than football. Gayton later taught high school and coached in Seattle before becoming the first Black FBI agent from Washington state. “I could have gotten a degree from what I learned in the FBI,” he says. After several years of federal employment around the country, Gayton returned to the UW in 1968 as its first Black full-time assistant football coach. Amid campus and team racial tensions, he recruited players and helped diversify the program. But in 1970, he resigned from the Athletics Department in protest over the suspension of several Black players. He stayed on campus, though, working as the first UW director of affirmative action programs. During this time, he also earned a Ph.D. in public administration. Gayton began a tenure-track career at Florida State University but was soon lured back to Seattle by a position at Boeing, where he worked for 18 years in roles including corporate director of college and university relations. From 1997 to 2001, he served as the Washington state commissioner of employment security. Throughout his career, Gayton remained connected to the UW as a lecturer at the Evans School of Public Policy & Governance and through numerous volunteer roles. In 2005, Gayton embarked on a new chapter, one that brought together his love of history and his commitment to community. He became the founding executive director of the Northwest African American Museum. Partnering with Barbara Earl Thomas, ’73, ’77, as deputy director, and Brian Carter, ’08, as education director, he helped shape the institution from the ground up. For Gayton, this wasn’t just a career move, it was a natural evolution of a lifelong pursuit, rooted in honoring the past and inspiring future generations. Gayton’s own story goes beyond career achievements or family legacy. It’s a testament to community, learning and perseverance. From believing the schoolteacher who once told him he was smarter than he realized to watching his daughter, Cynthia, become a national figure in technology and law, to navigating personal loss, Gayton describes his path as a journey built on embracing opportunities. “Expect nothing,” he says. “Appreciate everything.” Carver Gayton’s new book is available for purchase from UW Press.', 'pubDate': '2025-09-10 23:13:48', 'pubDateTZ': 'UTC', 'image_url': 'https://magazine.washington.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Carver-Gayton-sh-2000x1334-1.jpg', 'video_url': None, 'source_id': 'washington', 'source_name': 'University Of Washington', 'source_priority': 701, 'source_url': 'https://www.washington.edu', 'source_icon': 'https://n.bytvi.com/washington.png', 'language': 'english', 'country': ['united states of america'], 'category': ['lifestyle'], 'sentiment': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'sentiment_stats': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_tag': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_region': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_org': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_summary': \"Carver Gayton, a Seattle native, reflects on his great-grandfather Lewis Garrard Clarke's legacy as an Underground Railroad conductor and the inspiration behind his activism and academic pursuits.

They say it takes four to five hours per day for their developmentally disabled child to get to and from school. On the day CBS News New York spoke to him, Antonio Fazio didn\\'t look like it but was relieved to finally be home. The trip from the Sterling School in Cobble Hill to his house in Bergen Beach took a little over two hours. The fourth grader, who has ADHD, anxiety, and dyslexia, is enrolled in an individualized education program at the Sterling School, which was created for students with language-based disabilities. However, his parents say he sometimes misses the one-on-one literacy instruction first thing in the morning because he\\'s getting to school late. \"The whole reason we send him to this school is so he can get this instruction,\" Maria Fazio said. \"It\\'s tough. It\\'s tough on him. It\\'s tough on us,\" father Frank Fazio said. The boy\\'s parents say the school bus tasked with transporting him to and from school has about a dozen pickups along its route. Maria Fazio said sitting on the bus for more than 90 minutes is illegal. \"In my case, hopefully they follow his IEP, which says he shouldn\\'t be on the bus with more than five children, to alleviate the length of time that he\\'s traveling,\" Maria Fazio said. Antonio\\'s parents say they constantly have to adjust their schedules around their son\\'s pickup and drop off. Maria Fazio is a teacher, so her schedule is a bit more rigid. Frank Fazio is a firefighter who works the opposite shift and has to constantly say no to overtime. A representative from the Department of Education says it has a network of 9,000 routes that transport 150,000 students throughout the city, and, \"While almost all of our students receive quality, on-time service every single day, we take every individual report seriously and are actively looking into this incident so that we can address it appropriately.\" The DOE suggests families refer complaints to its call center, but the Fazio family says they have been sending emails and filing complaints with the City Council education chair, and DOE Office of Pupil Transportation for the two years Antonio has been at his new school -- to no avail. \"We\\'ve called OPT. We\\'ve filed complaints. We have multiple incident reports. We have multiple threads with staff members at OPT and DOB. Nothing gets done,\" Maria Fazio said. CBS News New York also reached out to the City Council education chair, but did not immediately hear back. The bus company, Y&M Transit, declined to comment.

Let us know. A few Camden residents appeared before the New Jersey State Board of Education to list their concerns about the Camden City School District, which has been under state control since 2013. During the Tuesday afternoon public comment period, residents said they are concerned about the lack of significant academic improvement in the district, the effects of deep cuts to address a $91 million deficit and the lack of transparency in the hiring process for the next superintendent of the state-run district. “Over a decade ago, the state of New Jersey took control of the Camden City School District promising to fix our failing schools and provide better outcomes for our children,” said Alesha Figueroa-Falcon, executive director of Parents Invincible, a nonprofit that advocates for school choice. “We are on the verge of a reality where Camden no longer has city public district schools. That’s unacceptable.” Faheem Lea, canvassing director and community liaison for Camden Parents Union, a community group, said he agrees with Figueroa-Falcon. “In the last 13 years or so, we’ve seen a sharp decline in schools and literacy rates, traditional public schools being closed and we’re seeing a lot of people leaving the district,” he said. Camden parents tell search firm what they want in the next leader of its state-run school district A national search firm has been collecting feedback from parents on characteristics they want in the next superintendent of the Camden City School District. 3 months ago The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that the district’s graduation rate showed modest gains , while the dropout rate has declined since 2013. But, student performance still lags behind the rest of the state. The district is also grappling with chronic absenteeism that is higher than before the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Lea said there is an opportunity to hire a superintendent who can improve the district, but the community needs to be part of the process. “We need to know who they are,” he said. “The community needs to be involved and who is coming to our city to regulate the Camden City School District.” Kevin Waters, who retired from the Camden City School District before the recent cuts were implemented, said the support staff who lost their jobs due to the budget crunch served critical roles in schools. “As a therapist and a counselor myself, those individuals who were let go, were a part of a function to help in the way of providing students supports,” he said. “Those individuals on some level need to be able to come back.” Wednesday’s public testimony session was one of three scheduled by the state board for the school year where people can come to speak about any topic they wish to address. The other sessions are scheduled for January and May, according to the state’s website . Camden students and parents are rallying against deep school cuts: ‘They don’t care about us’ The cuts, which include hundreds of jobs, will affect essential staff and programs, district families say. 4 months ago At least 20 people registered in advance to speak before the board. They were split up into two groups. The majority of concerns from Camden residents were heard by board Vice President Nedd James Johnson and Board Member Jack Fornaro. At the beginning of the meeting, Johnson said that testimony would be shared with other board members. Last June , students from the Camden district tried to address the state board, but board members were not taking public comments. That prompted the students to hold a rally outside of the Department of Education building to express their concerns and opposition to the district’s budget cuts. Get daily updates from WHYY News!

Olayemi Cardoso, CBN Gov At the recent inaugural meeting of the PSV 2028 Project Committee held in Lagos, Musa Jimoh, director of the Payments System Policy Department (PSPD), described the initiative as a “national assignment” with the potential to transform how individuals, businesses, and governments interact within the financial ecosystem. Reflecting on the journey from the early reforms of 2006 through the milestones of PSV 2020 and PSV 2025, Jimoh highlighted that the new vision will build on past achievements to deepen financial inclusion. This, he noted, will improve infrastructure interoperability and promote innovation across Nigeria’s financial services sector. He observed that while Nigeria’s payment system has made significant progress over the past two decades, the speed of technological advancement and innovation continues to grow. PSV 2028, he explained, presents the country with a unique chance to develop a future-ready framework that is secure, efficient, and globally competitive. He further explained that the framework would be developed through an inclusive, stakeholder-led process that unites regulators, banks, fintechs, payment service providers, consumer advocacy groups, and other key players. He highlighted that this collaborative approach will ensure the strategy reflects real-world needs, fosters policy acceptance, and promotes innovation through shared responsibility. To facilitate its implementation, five thematic working groups were established, concentrating on: Infrastructure & Interoperability; Digital Financial Inclusion, Consumer Protection & Financial Literacy; Innovation, Digital Identity & Emerging Technologies; Cross-Border Payments & CBDC Integration; and Regulation, Risk Management & Cybersecurity. A sixth group on Strategic Communications and Stakeholder Engagement was also proposed. Participants at the event welcomed the initiative, praising the CBN’s inclusive approach and highlighting the pivotal role of PSV 2028 in promoting digital innovation, financial inclusion, and economic resilience. By sharing expertise and resources, they committed to creating a forward-looking document that would strengthen Nigeria’s position in Africa’s payments landscape while making progress globally. Also, speaking at the event, Mr. Ajao Niyi, former chief executive of the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS), praised the CBN for establishing a new standard for stakeholder engagement and urged all parties to unite in support of the initiative. The PSV 2028, which succeeds the soon-to-expire PSV 2025, is expected to serve as the guiding blueprint for Nigeria’s digital payments ecosystem over the next three years, aligning the country’s financial system with global best practices and ensuring sustainable growth.

A fifth (20%) said they could not afford an unexpected but necessary expense of £200, making them potentially vulnerable if, for example, their washing machine or boiler broke down and needed replacing or repairing. Nearly half (48%) have cut back on hobbies and entertainment and 43% have reduced spending on gifts or donations, while 24% said they can rarely, if ever, afford the non-essentials that make life enjoyable. Two-fifths (42%) of pensioners on a low income had considered themselves to be middle- to high-earners for the bulk of their working lives before retirement. Meanwhile, 21% said they use their savings to cover everyday expenses, according to the survey, carried out by Savanta, among more than 500 people aged 66-plus across the UK in June. For the research, people were defined as being on a low income if they were below the threshold for a “living pension”. Different thresholds were used to account for people’s different living circumstances. For example, the monthly income threshold for a single homeowner was £1,162 but for a couple renting privately it was £2,489. More than a quarter (26%) of those surveyed said their income makes them more anxious and 25% said it has worsened their sleep. The research also indicated that pensioners who rent or live alone were more likely to be in debt. Some 43% of renters were in some level of debt compared with 23% of homeowners. And 40% of people living alone were in debt compared with 25% of people living with a partner. Around a third (34%) of people living alone said they could not afford an unexpected but necessary expense of £200 compared to 14% of people living with a partner. Meanwhile 31% of renters and 15% of homeowners said they would not be able to meet a £200 unexpected cost. The research also found that many of those on low incomes were reliant on the state pension as their main source of income, with 54% having no workplace pension to draw on. The Living Wage Foundation’s living pension accreditation is a voluntary savings target for employers looking to help workers build up a pension pot to meet at least their basic needs in retirement.

Three in 10 (30%) said they are in some level of debt and just over a third (35%) said they rely on money from other sources such as benefits or money from friends, family, a partner to get by. A fifth (20%) said they could not afford an unexpected but necessary expense of £200, making them potentially vulnerable if, for example, their washing machine or boiler broke down and needed replacing or repairing. Nearly half (48%) have cut back on hobbies and entertainment and 43% have reduced spending on gifts or donations, while 24% said they can rarely, if ever, afford the non-essentials that make life enjoyable. Two-fifths (42%) of pensioners on a low income had considered themselves to be middle- to high-earners for the bulk of their working lives before retirement. Meanwhile, 21% said they use their savings to cover everyday expenses, according to the survey, carried out by Savanta, among more than 500 people aged 66-plus across the UK in June. For the research, people were defined as being on a low income if they were below the threshold for a “living pension”. Different thresholds were used to account for people’s different living circumstances. For example, the monthly income threshold for a single homeowner was £1,162 but for a couple renting privately it was £2,489. More than a quarter (26%) of those surveyed said their income makes them more anxious and 25% said it has worsened their sleep. The research also indicated that pensioners who rent or live alone were more likely to be in debt. Some 43% of renters were in some level of debt compared with 23% of homeowners. And 40% of people living alone were in debt compared with 25% of people living with a partner. Around a third (34%) of people living alone said they could not afford an unexpected but necessary expense of £200 compared to 14% of people living with a partner. Meanwhile 31% of renters and 15% of homeowners said they would not be able to meet a £200 unexpected cost. The research also found that many of those on low incomes were reliant on the state pension as their main source of income, with 54% having no workplace pension to draw on. The Living Wage Foundation’s living pension accreditation is a voluntary savings target for employers looking to help workers build up a pension pot to meet at least their basic needs in retirement. Living pension employers commit to providing a living pension savings level, using either a cash or percentage target.

Eligible projects can receive up to $50,000 in matching funds to build a new playground. Funds can also be used to add new equipment or replace components on an existing playground. “The province is investing $3.75 million annually over the next four years to enrich outdoor play spaces throughout Saskatchewan,” Parks, Culture and Sport Minister Alana Ross said. “This program supports the incredible work done by volunteer school community councils and parent groups who raise money to create safe, accessible playgrounds for their children. It benefits the kids, families, and their communities, and I look forward to seeing more projects break ground.” The application period will run from Sept. 9 to Feb. 25, on a first-come, first-served basis. The program will be administered in partnership with the Saskatchewan Parks and Recreation Association (SPRA). “Playgrounds are critical spaces that contribute to a healthy Saskatchewan population,” Saskatchewan Parks and Recreation Association President Darcy McLeod said. “Investments like the School Playground Equipment Grant help instill the importance of play and physical literacy in our children and youth, which in turn will build a more active future for our province.” The program is open to school community councils and parent groups affiliated with publicly funded schools, school divisions, and First Nation schools in Saskatchewan. Publicly funded schools include: public, separate, Francophone, Independent (including alternative independent schools, associate schools, historical high schools, qualified independent schools, and certified independent schools) and First Nations schools. Overview of the eligibility criteria: Full guidelines along with the online grant application are available on the SPRA website . paNOW also attempted to contact the Prince Albert Catholic School Division for comment but they did not respond in time for the publication deadline. — nigel.maxwell@pattisonmedia.com On X: @nigelmaxwell', 'pubDate': '2025-09-10 23:00:14', 'pubDateTZ': 'UTC', 'image_url': 'https://d2ksr9467jthww.cloudfront.net/20250910220912/9bbf6b58e617f3e084b2c481aaafe0918729631581bacfcd0c042b17a9d75836.jpg', 'video_url': None, 'source_id': 'panow', 'source_name': 'Panow', 'source_priority': 679627, 'source_url': 'https://panow.com', 'source_icon': 'https://n.bytvi.com/panow.jpg', 'language': 'english', 'country': ['canada'], 'category': ['education', 'top'], 'sentiment': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'sentiment_stats': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_tag': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_region': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_org': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_summary': 'The Saskatchewan government has announced a School Playground Equipment Grant program, offering up to $50,000 in matching funds for new playgrounds or equipment upgrades.

Nominations are then reviewed by the WIRSA 20-member board and a recommendation for the winner is made. Clinton School District Administrator Jim Brewer nominated Stewart for the award. She was principal at Clinton Middle School for three years and she now is entering her fifth year as principal of the Clinton Junior/Senior High School. Before becoming a principal, Stewart was a seventh grade science teacher in the Clinton district. Stewart is recognized for her outstanding leadership, innovative practices, and dedication to rural education. She has led with vision and compassion, guiding students and staff to higher levels of achievement while fostering an inclusive and supportive school culture. Stewart played a key role during the district’s reorganization from three buildings to two. “Erika brings out the best in her staff and students, combining strength, kindness, fairness, and compassion,” said Dr. Jim Brewer, District Administrator of the Clinton Community School District. “Her leadership has not only advanced Clinton Junior/Senior High School but has made a tremendous impact on our entire community.” Stewart’s work extends beyond the classroom, as she consistently engages families, educators, and community members in the decision-making process. Known for empowering teachers and celebrating the potential of every student, she embodies the very best of rural education leadership. “Erika Stewart is an outstanding principal who has consistently provided me with the space, support, and opportunities to grow both inside and outside the classroom,\" said Clinton teacher Ryan Brandon. \"Her willingness to listen and offer her wisdom has been invaluable. She is a true asset to Clinton Junior/Senior High School, and I am incredibly grateful for her guidance.” “It is not easy being the leader of a middle school and it is not easy being the leader of a high school; however, the job is twice as difficult when you are the leader of a 7–12 building,\" said Clinton teacher Dave Fridley. \"Erika has successfully led us in the creation of Clinton Junior/Senior High School.

Underpinning this localised effort is the Poverty Task Force, established in 2024.

The private school, which serves low-income students and operates on a pay-what-you-can model, is positioning itself to take advantage of Texas\\' new Education Savings Account program, also known as the school choice program. \"Salvation is free, but everything else costs,\" said Shailendra Thomas, head of school at The King\\'s Academy, highlighting the financial challenges faced by families seeking private education alternatives. The school relies on fundraising to serve its student population, and Thomas said money is always tight. But the new state program could provide relief. Acting Texas State Comptroller Kelly Hancock, who oversees the billion-dollar program, recently met with students and teachers at the academy to explain how the system will work, and get feedback on new rules , so the office is ready to launch in January. \"There\\'s a billion dollars in the program and frankly, I\\'d love to sell out,\" Hancock said, emphasizing the state\\'s commitment to the initiative. Under the program, qualifying students can receive approximately $10,000 annually, with additional funding available for students with specialized needs. The program uses public dollars to support private education, homeschooling, or other state-approved programs.

ALSO READ: Holidays: Five ways to guide children on healthy screen habits The study, which analyzed data from more than 100,000 young people worldwide, links early smartphone ownership to suicidal thoughts, aggression, and detachment from reality, hallucinations, poor self-worth, and weakened emotional regulation. Published in the Journal of Human Development and Capabilities, the research is based on Sapien Labs’ Global Mind Project, the world’s largest database on mental wellbeing. ALSO READ: Mental health: Understanding risks of social media addiction, finding balance Findings show that 18- to 24-year-olds who had smartphones at age 12 or younger were far more likely to report severe psychological symptoms. Using the Mind Health Quotient (MHQ) tool, researchers found scores fell suddenly the earlier a child acquired a device, from an average of 30 at age 13 to 1 for those given one at age five. The study identifies early social media access as the single biggest driver of poor outcomes, explaining about 40% of the link, followed by disrupted family relationships (13%), disturbed sleep (12%), and cyberbullying (10%). Girls who received smartphones earlier were more likely to struggle with self-worth, body image, and emotional stability, while boys reported less confidence, lower empathy, and poorer self-image. Lead author Dr. Tara Thiagarajan, founder and Chief Scientist of Sapien Labs, said the findings suggest symptoms go beyond depression and anxiety, extending to aggression, suicidal thoughts, and detachment that traditional screeners (standard tests) often miss. With the average age of first ownership now below 13 globally, she called for urgent policy action similar to regulations on alcohol and tobacco. The researchers recommend four measures; mandatory digital literacy and mental health education, strict enforcement of social media age rules with accountability for tech companies, restrictions on children’s access to platforms, and progressive limits on smartphone use. Several countries including France, the Netherlands, Italy, and New Zealand have restricted phones in schools, with New York recently joining a number of U.S. states adopting bans to improve student focus. In an interview with The New Times, Dr. Darius Gishoma, the Division Manager for Mental Health at the Rwanda Biomedical Centre (RBC), said Rwanda has yet to generate comprehensive national data linking smartphone use to mental health concerns among children and adolescents, though evidence from other parts of the world shows serious risks. “For Rwanda, we don’t have specific data on this, but clinical experience shows screen overuse often appears as an associated problem when young people present with issues such as alcohol addiction, depression, or gambling,” he explained. He added that most research identifies several categories of children, those below five, those between five and 12, and adolescents, who face high risks from screen exposure. Among the most commonly reported effects is disruption of natural sleep cycles. “Children spending long hours on screens sleep less, and poor sleep impacts cognitive function,” he said. Dr. Gishoma added that excessive screen use interferes with social interaction as children who spend too much time on screens tend to interact less with their peers or parents. He added that high usage leads to hyperarousal (heightened alertness), concentration difficulties, negative emotions, and conduct problems, noting that there are so many studies showing the negative impact on social interaction, cognitive function, emotional stability, and behavioral issues. While clinical consultations rarely refer to screen addiction as the leading cause, he noted it frequently emerges during assessments. “It is not often the main complaint, but we discover it is associated once we dig deeper into the person’s problems,” he said. He cautioned that excessive screen use is linked to sedentary lifestyles such as prolonged sitting, binge-watching videos, and spending hours on social media, which may increase the risk of obesity and other physical health problems. When asked about strategies to address smartphone-related mental health risks in Rwanda, Gishoma said the country is focusing on three main approaches: public awareness campaigns, school-based interventions, and treatment for severe cases, noting that general awareness of these risks already exists, partly due to media discussions. “We also have the school-based mental health program, introduced four years ago, which addresses risky behaviours in schools, including excessive screen use. And when there is real screen addiction, treatment services are available.” On age-appropriate smartphone use, the mental health expert mentioned the role of parents, noting that experts recommend no screen time for children under two or three years, and no more than one hour per day for older children. While these guidelines can be adapted to Rwanda, the primary responsibility for managing usage according to age lies with parents, he added. Dr. Gishoma said young people are more vulnerable to cyberbullying and unhealthy comparisons on social media. He explained that harsh feedback about appearance or lifestyle can harm their emotional wellbeing, and that social media often blurs the line between private and public life. “The school-based mental health program, which began in 2020, is already operational in 17 of 30 districts, including Karongi, Bugesera, and Gicumbi. In these schools, we try to have both a male and female counselor, who help with awareness, screening, and linking children with challenges to care. The program is being scaled up progressively to reach all districts,” he said.', 'pubDate': '2025-09-10 22:39:30', 'pubDateTZ': 'UTC', 'image_url': 'https://www.newtimes.co.rw/thenewtimes/uploads/images/2025/09/11/86132.jpg', 'video_url': None, 'source_id': 'newtimes', 'source_name': 'The New Times', 'source_priority': 315985, 'source_url': 'https://www.newtimes.co.rw', 'source_icon': 'https://n.bytvi.com/newtimes.png', 'language': 'english', 'country': ['rwanda'], 'category': ['health', 'top'], 'sentiment': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'sentiment_stats': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_tag': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_region': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_org': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_summary': \"Global research indicates that children who receive their first smartphone before age 13 are at a higher risk for long-term mental health issues, including suicidal thoughts, aggression, and detachment.

The agency said it’s holding back a total of $350 million in grants budgeted for this year and called on Congress to “reenvision” the programs for future years.More than $250 million of that figure was budgeted for the government’s Hispanic-Serving Institution program, which offers grants to colleges and universities where at least a quarter of undergraduates are Hispanic. Congress created the program in 1998 after finding that Latino students were going to college and graduating at far lower rates than white students.Several smaller programs are also being cut, including $22 million for schools where at least 40% of students are Black, along with programs reserved for schools with certain enrollment levels of Asian American, Pacific Islander or Native American students. The programs have traditionally received bipartisan support in Congress and were created to address longstanding racial disparities in education.Not included in the cuts is federal funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities, which are open to all students regardless of race.“Diversity is not merely the presence of a skin color,” Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement Wednesday. “Stereotyping an individual based on immutable characteristics diminishes the full picture of that person’s life and contributions, including their character, resiliency, and merit.”McMahon added that she aims to work with Congress to repurpose the funding for institutions that serve “underprepared or under-resourced” students without using quotas. She did not elaborate on plans to repurpose the $350 million.The government’s grants for Hispanic-Serving Institutions are being challenged in a federal lawsuit brought by the state of Tennessee and the anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions. Tennessee argues that all of its public universities serve Hispanic students, but none meet the “arbitrary ethnic threshold” to be eligible for the grants.The Justice Department declined to defend the grants in the lawsuit, saying in a July memo that the 25% enrollment requirement violates the Constitution.In court filings, a national association of Hispanic-Serving Institutions said the grants are legal and help put its members on an even playing field.More than 500 colleges and universities are designated as Hispanic-Serving Institutions, making them eligible for the grants. It includes flagship campuses like the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Arizona, along with many community colleges and smaller institutions.Related ArticlesThese Orange County students are 2026 National Merit Scholarship semifinalistsThis California town was ravaged by a wildfire.

Even so, the department said it “continues to consider the underlying legal issues associated with the mandatory funding mechanism in these programs.”Former President Joe Biden made Hispanic universities a priority, signing an executive action last year that promised a new presidential advisory board and increased funding.

In a letter to Chairman James Comer (R-KY) and ranking member Robert Garcia (D-CA), Bowser pointed to some of the city’s progress on crime and public safety and argued the proposed legislation would make the city “less safe.” Bowser said the city has “worked collaboratively with this Committee on shared priorities,” but that she now asks that the committee “reject 13 of the DC bills before you today that encroach on DC’s Home Rule.” The city’s home rule allows residents to elect the mayor and the D.C. Council. The mayor specifically objected to House Rule 5183, the District of Columbia Home Rule Improvement Act, which would impose a 60-day congressional review for D.C. Council legislation, and H.R. 521, the District of Columbia Cash Bail Reform Act, which would mandate pretrial detention and cash bail for those charged with public safety offenses. Bowser argued that the Home Rule Improvement Act would “make the District less efficient, competitive, and responsive to the needs of a highly complex unique local government that serves local, county and state functions.” On the proposed cash bail reform, Bowser said the city’s “recent changes to our laws related to pre-trial detention [helped] to drive down violent crime in the last two years.” The mayor also asked the committee not to end the district’s education-funding Scholarships for Opportunity and Results Act. The committee has not yet released exact details on what it would end, but Bowser said she has been a career advocate of funding public, private, and charter schools. “Mayoral control, council oversight, and deep, targeted investments in our students, teachers, and buildings made these remarkable achievements possible,” she wrote.

The Education Ministry, in a recent Dewan Rakyat sitting, announced that the subject will focus on building learners’ foundations in artificial intelligence (AI). The ministry added that the subject will carry through into secondary school, complementing related areas such as computer science, information and communications technology, and design and technology. On top of this, school curriculums will also include the “Fasih Digital” (digital literacy) programme, which has been identified as one of the seven core competency modules every student must master. This move is, without doubt, a reflection of how deeply technology is shaping not only our future, but also our classrooms. It also reflects the Education Ministry’s commitment in ensuring students, across the nation, are given early exposures to AI. The initiative is commendable, as AI is no longer just a futuristic concept but an integral part of our daily lives. From the way we shop online, interact with customer service bots, consume news, or even navigate traffic, AI quietly powers much of our routines. The decision to introduce AI in primary schools shows recognition that the future workforce cannot afford to be passive consumers of technology. It is no exaggeration to say that equipping young learners with AI knowledge and skills early will provide them with competencies that are not only relevant today but also critical for tomorrow’s job market. As industries—from healthcare to agriculture—rapidly embed AI into their operations, the demand for digitally literate workers will only continue to grow. Starting early also offers psychological benefits, as children are naturally curious and adaptive. By learning AI concepts at an age when imagination runs wild, they are more likely to approach the technology with a sense of possibility rather than fear. Learning these skills at an early age will undoubtedly nurture creativity and curiosity. It enables students to see AI not just as users, but as creators and innovators. For instance, instead of merely playing with apps, children could learn how those apps are designed, how chatbots are trained, or how algorithms make decisions. Experts often stress that introducing AI early helps to demystify the subject. Just as learning a second language becomes easier for children than for adults, learning the language of AI early will make it less intimidating as they grow. By normalising AI from the start, students may develop a sense of ownership over technology, not intimidation. This shift in mindset—from passive use to active creation—is crucial if Malaysia is serious about preparing a workforce capable of not only adopting AI but shaping it. But, for all its promise, this initiative also raises bigger questions. Are our schools truly ready to teach AI to children as young as seven? AI is not like teaching basic mathematics or spelling — it involves concepts that can be abstract and technical. Without proper training, there is a risk that teachers may struggle to simplify AI for young learners, leading to rote memorisation instead of genuine understanding. Are parents and teachers adequately prepared to guide children through such a leap? Parents play a critical role in reinforcing classroom learning at home. But if many parents themselves are unfamiliar with AI, how can they confidently support their children? Likewise, teachers must be given sufficient training, resources, and ongoing support to ensure they are not overwhelmed by yet another subject added to their already demanding workload. And perhaps most crucially, will this new subject ignite genuine curiosity and innovation—or will it risk becoming just another textbook-driven, exam-oriented subject? Malaysia’s education system has long been criticised for encouraging memorisation over critical thinking. If AI education becomes reduced to definitions, diagrams, and test answers, then the entire purpose of introducing it at an early age will be defeated. Bear in mind, if the ministry proceeds with this initiative, schools, students, teachers, and parents will have just over a year to prepare. That timeline is not generous. Preparing for AI education is not merely about printing new textbooks—it involves teacher training, curriculum development, infrastructure upgrades (such as ensuring schools have sufficient devices and internet access), and parental engagement. Consider rural schools, where even basic internet connectivity can be unreliable. How will they cope with a subject that requires exposure to digital tools and platforms? If the implementation gap is too wide, students in rural areas risk being left behind, thus widening the digital divide that already exists. That said, this initiative should not be viewed only through the lens of challenges. It also presents a rare opportunity to rethink how we teach. AI cannot be learned meaningfully through rote exercises; it demands experimentation, creativity, and problem-solving. Imagine if AI classes encouraged children to design simple projects — like creating chatbots that answer fun questions, or coding small programmes that recommend books based on preferences. Such activities could spark joy in learning, nurture innovation, and instil problem-solving skills that are transferable to many areas of life. Furthermore, by embedding AI into subjects like science, mathematics, or even art, students could see how technology intersects with different fields. This multidisciplinary approach would not only make AI more relatable but also break down silos in how knowledge is delivered. If the Education Ministry wants to be serious about this, preparation cannot be left until the last minute. Teacher training must begin immediately. Collaboration with universities, tech companies, and educational NGOs could help create training modules that are practical and accessible. Parents must also be engaged through awareness programmes, so they too can understand and support what their children are learning. The ministry must also be mindful of balancing ambition with reality. Rolling out AI education across the board is commendable, but it must not come at the expense of further straining schools that already lack resources. Ensuring equitable access should be the guiding principle. The introduction of Technology and Digital, with AI at its heart, marks a bold step towards aligning Malaysia’s education system with the realities of the 21st century. It is a recognition that the future will belong to those who can understand, navigate, and shape technology. But bold steps require careful preparation. We must ensure that this initiative does not simply add another subject to the timetable but becomes a catalyst for nurturing creativity, innovation, and critical thinking. Otherwise, the promise of teaching AI to seven-year-olds may risk becoming just another missed opportunity. With just over a year before the rollout, the clock is ticking.

It\\'s the foundation of critical thinking, innovation, and the technologies that power our daily lives. Without it, we don\\'t just lose scientists in lab coats; we lose innovators, problem-solvers, and leaders across every industry. The 2025 Year 12 Physics Participation Report Card , released by the Australian Mathematical Sciences Institute and the Australian Institute of Physics, paints a bleak picture. Male participation has dropped from 23.5 per cent in 2015 to 18.9 per cent. Female participation has fallen even further, from 7 per cent to just 5.8 per cent. For decades, only one in four year 12 physics students has been female. No progress has been made in closing that gap. These numbers are more than statistics. They are a warning. Physics is not a niche field. It underpins healthcare, engineering, defence, finance, computing and energy. From MRI machines in hospitals, to renewable energy systems, to the algorithms inside our smartphones - physics is everywhere. Here in the Hunter, I see the impact first-hand. I\\'ve taught and mentored physics students at the University of Newcastle, and I\\'ve watched where they end up. Yes, many become engineers. But that\\'s only part of the story. Our graduates are now data scientists at CSIRO, medical physicists in hospitals, software engineers at Telstra and Optus, and project managers at BHP and Ericsson. Some have become patent attorneys, lawyers at ASIC, or data analysts at the Australian Taxation Office. Others have stepped into leadership, becoming CEOs of local start-ups right here in the Hunter. And that\\'s just from Newcastle graduates. When physics enrolments fall, we don\\'t just lose scientists. We lose innovators across every corner of our economy. The future of clean energy, advanced computing, medical technology and national security depends on a steady pipeline of people trained to think critically and solve complex problems. That\\'s what physics does best. So why are students turning away? The reasons are complex, but some patterns are clear. Physics is often labelled as difficult or abstract, and schools under pressure sometimes guide students towards \"easier\" subjects to maximise marks. Students also rarely see physicists who look like them, especially young women. In many rural and regional areas, the shortage of specialist physics teachers makes high-quality physics education even harder to access. Another barrier is perception. Too often, students believe \"physics\" must appear in a job title for it to matter. In reality, physics skills open doors in industries where the word never appears. Without visible career pathways, some students never see the value of sticking with it. This is where we must act. We need to make physics engaging and practical without watering it down. Students should see how it connects to the real world: from designing safer cars to modelling climate change. We need more hands-on experiments, more industry partnerships, and more visible role models in classrooms. We must also tackle gender equity head-on. It\\'s not enough to say \"physics is for everyone\". We need programs that actively encourage girls to take and stay in physics, backed by mentoring, scholarships and visibility campaigns. And above all, we need to value our teachers. A physics classroom lives or dies on the passion of the person at the front. If we don\\'t invest in training and retaining great physics teachers, the decline will only accelerate. Physics may be disappearing from our classrooms. But it doesn\\'t have to. If we act now - as educators, parents, policymakers and industry leaders - we can turn this around. Because this isn\\'t just about science education. It\\'s about Australia\\'s future workforce, our economy, and the innovations that will shape the world our kids inherit. I hope next year\\'s report tells a different story. But that will happen only if we all step up. Daily Today\\'s top stories curated by our news team. Also includes evening update.

The Director-General of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Dr Emomotimi Agama, gave the charge while delivering the 23rd Convocation Lecture for the 72 Regular Course and postgraduate students in Kaduna on Wednesday. Agama urged the cadets to clearly define their financial goals, both short and long term, and align their strategies with an ideal future that prioritises economic independence. “Public servants, traditionally reliant on fixed salaries and pensions, can achieve economic prosperity by strategically engaging with the capital market. “Capital markets, comprising stock exchanges, bond markets, and alternative investments, offer opportunities for wealth creation, passive income, and financial security. However, participation requires financial literacy,” Agama said. He explained that securities not only provide investors with a wide range of options to match their risk appetite and return expectations but also enable issuers—companies and governments – to raise much-needed capital for development projects. “Ultimately, the securities market serves as a vehicle to meet the complementary goals of both issuers and investors. Opportunities abound through equities, bonds, collective investment schemes, commodities, digital assets, and derivatives,” he added, while cautioning cadets to engage only with SEC-registered entities to safeguard their funds. In his remarks, NDA Commandant, Major General A. K. Ibrahim, noted that many officers face financial challenges after retirement due to poor resource management during their service years. “The reason we are having this lecture is because of the value we place on investment and empowerment issues for the military. With this enlightenment, our officers and men will be better positioned to manage their resources and secure wealth for their families,” he said .', 'pubDate': '2025-09-10 21:51:00', 'pubDateTZ': 'UTC', 'image_url': 'https://tribuneonlineng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Security-and-Exchange-Commission-SEC-e1475583384273.jpg', 'video_url': None, 'source_id': 'tribuneonlineng', 'source_name': 'Tribune', 'source_priority': 84500, 'source_url': 'https://tribuneonlineng.com', 'source_icon': 'https://n.bytvi.com/tribuneonlineng.png', 'language': 'english', 'country': ['nigeria'], 'category': ['top', 'business'], 'sentiment': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'sentiment_stats': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_tag': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_region': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_org': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_summary': \"Graduating cadets from Nigeria's Defence Academy are encouraged to invest in the capital market for long-term financial security.

الرقمي\"، وفي دمج المهارات الرقمية ضمن المناهج الدراسية، إلى جانب برامج التدريب وورش العمل التي تستهدف موظفي القطاعين العام والخاص والقطاع غير الربحي. كما أطلقت الهيئة السعودية للبيانات والذكاء الاصطناعي (سدايا) بالتعاون مع وزارتي التعليم والموارد البشرية والتنمية الاجتماعية مبادرة مليون سعودي للذكاء الاصطناعي \"سماي\"، لتدريب مليون مواطن ومواطنة على مهارات وتقنيات الذكاء الاصطناعي، دعمًا لبناء القدرات الوطنية وتحقيقًا لمستهدفات الرؤية الطموحة. إن تعزيز محو الأمية الرقمية يسهم في ترسيخ الاقتصاد الرقمي عبر دعم التجارة الإلكترونية، وتشجيع ريادة الأعمال التقنية، وتمكين المرأة والشباب من خلال فرص عمل جديدة وتطوير مهاراتهم المستقبلية، كما يسهم في حماية المجتمع من المخاطر الرقمية كالاحتيال الإلكتروني واستغلال البيانات، وتحسين جودة الحياة عبر الخدمات الحكومية الرقمية التي توفر الوقت والجهد على المواطن والمقيم والزائر. إضافة إلى ذلك، فهو يحد من الفجوة الرقمية بين الفئات العمرية والجغرافية والاجتماعية، ويعزز مكانة السعودية عالميًا كدولة رائدة في الاقتصاد الرقمي. إن محو الأمية الرقمية لم يعد خيارًا تنمويًا، بل أصبح ضرورة وطنية تمس الاقتصاد والأمن وجودة الحياة. فمَن يفتقد المهارة الرقمية اليوم سيفتقد غدًا القدرة على التعلم والعمل والتواصل. ومن هنا، فإن الاستثمار في محو الأمية الرقمية هو استثمار في الإنسان، الركيزة الأولى لكل نهضة وتنمية، وخطوة حاسمة نحو بناء مجتمع معرفي متكامل قادر على المنافسة عالميًا.', 'pubDate': '2025-09-10 21:50:27',

native on an unofficial visit, checking in with the Rebels.', 'content': \"Monroe (La.) Ouachita Parish four-star defensive lineman Dylan Berymon will be in Oxford this weekend for the Ole Miss' Rebels SEC clash against the Arkansas Razorbacks. Berymon, the No. 4 rated prospect in Louisiana, revealed a commitment to Steve Sarkisian and the Texas Longhorns in June, but it hasn't stopped programs from remaining in contact. That includes Lane Kiffin and the Ole Miss Rebels with the program looking to stack talent in the trenches for the 2026 Recruiting Cycle. The 6-foot-1, 330-pounder has earned a myriad of offers across his time on the prep scene with the LSU Tigers, North Carolina Tar Heels, Oregon Ducks, Miami Hurricanes, and Mississippi State Bulldogs, among others, entering the race. But it's the Texas Longhorns that hold the verbal pledge after turning up the heat during the summer. Across his last two season on the high school scene, Berymon has logged more than 65 total tackles, including 15 for loss, to go along with 10 sacks. Now, the coveted defensive lineman will be up in Oxford (Miss.) this weekend for the Rebels' clash against the Arkansas Razorbacks. For Kiffin and Ole Miss program, all focus is on stacking talent in the 2026 Recruiting Cycle with the program fresh off of flipping UCF Knights defensive line pledge Jayden Curtis. The Ocean Springs (Miss.) native quickly emerged as a talented under-the-radar prospect in the Magnolia State with Kiffin and Co. turning up the heat across the offseason. The Mississippi native made his way up to Oxford in June to compete in the program's offensive line/defensive line camp without an offer in-hand, but after a strong performance, received a scholarship from the hometown program. Now, after a hard push, Ole Miss has added a talented piece to the trenches in the 2026 class after flipping him away from UCF. “The Rebels remained in touch and pushed the right buttons during his visit while showing how successful he can be on and off the field close to home,” Rivals wrote . “His father played basketball for Ole Miss, and he has family connections who live within a short distance of the campus. And the Rebels’ production and development along the defensive line is a major feather in their cap, too.” No. 17 Ole Miss will return to action on Saturday night at Vaught Hemingway Stadium for an SEC matchup against the Arkansas Razorbacks.

(WV News) -- The Jackson County Board of Education members spent a substantial amount of time learning about the FOCUS plans that each school develops.', 'content': 'RIPLEY, W.Va. (WV News) -- The Jackson County Board of Education members spent a substantial amount of time learning about the FOCUS plans that each school develops. Dr. Bill Chapman, Director of Federal Programs and Child Nutrition, explained the process that provides schools with the means to develop action plans. “FOCUS is an acronym,” Chapman explained, “It stands for find the starting point, organize the data, communicate the goals and action steps, involve the stakeholders, and sustain the monitoring.” Each staff member is given an opportunity to take an anonymous survey in which they rate their school in seven areas, including home-school communication, high expectations, facilities, and technology. These are called ‘self-reflection surveys.’ Dr. Chapman and his team compile the data to send a report to the school’s administration. The school’s principal works with his staff to brainstorm and develop an action plan to address any issues. “This is our third year doing this,” Chapman said. “We were able to identify problems and work on solutions. Teachers and support staff are saying this is the first time they have felt heard.” This year, unlike the past, the county administration will ‘focus’ on six schools rather than all twelve. The other six will be the focus next year. “We will be working with Kenna, Ripley Elementary, Ripley Middle, Ravenswood Middle, Ripley High, and Gilmore,” Chapman stated. The survey has received over 200 responses so far this year. “We are seeing lower dissatisfaction results,” he said. “That is encouraging.” Enrollment has increased slightly (by three students) compared to the end of the previous school year, at 3,945. The full impact of the Hope Scholarship, which provides state funds for students attending private schools, has yet to be calculated. The full scholarship is available in August, but it goes down incrementally. The superintendent was asked to provide an update at the end of the 45 days allowed for Hope Scholarship applications. Assistant Superintendent of Non-Instructional Services Tim Brown gave his construction update: Superintendent Will Hosaflook discussed an unsigned letter he had received. He said he normally doesn’t address these types of correspondence, but this one questioned and criticized contributions to community events. “We represent the community and the community represents us,” Hosaflook said. “Much of the time given, such as helping with races, is done for free, for no personal gain.” Board member Bea Isner expressed her views. “Schools are the hub of our community,” she said. “And the community is the hub of the school. For anyone to complain about this assistance is just sad.” In other business, board members Jim Frazier, Ben Mize, Steve Chancey, Dan Barnette, and Isner: To start the board meeting, a retiree was honored. Stacy Riffe retired with 32 years of service at Ripley High School. “It has been a blessing and an honor,” Riffe said. “I owe it all to God.” The board went into a closed-door executive meeting to discuss the superintendent’s goals for the 2025-26 school year. Those goals were not shared after returning to the open meeting. It was explained that the goals were used to determine the superintendent’s evaluation at the end of the school year.

Robert F Kennedy Jr, the new leader of the HHS, oversaw the agency\\'s new email to employees on Tuesday entitled \"AI Deployment.\" Why It Matters Kennedy has received a wide range of backlash since taking on the job of HHS Secretary. More than 1,000 current and former employees of the HHS called for Kennedy to resign in an open letter earlier this month, citing several actions that continue \"to endanger the nation\\'s health,\" according to the letter. Artificial intelligence has grown in popularity, transforming workplaces, healthcare and education. However, experts say its use in a government healthcare setting could have longstanding implications for both workers and beneficiaries alike.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. appears before the Senate Finance Committee at the Dirksen Senate Office Building on September 04, 2025, in Washington, D.C. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images What To Know ChatGPT will now be available to all workers at HHS, and its deployment will be overseen by HHS\\'s new CIO, former Palantir employee Clark Minor, according to the email. \"Artificial intelligence is beginning to improve health care, business, and government,\" the email, sent by deputy secretary Jim O\\'Neill, said. \"Our department is committed to supporting and encouraging this transformation. In many offices around the world, the growing administrative burden of extensive emails and meetings can distract even highly motivated people from getting things done. We should all be vigilant against barriers that could slow our progress toward making America healthy again.\" The email continued to say ChatGPT would be available to everyone in the department effective immediately. \"Some operating divisions, such as FDA and ACF (Administration for Children and Families), have already benefitted from specific deployments of large language models to enhance their work, and now the rest of us can join them. This tool can help us promote rigorous science, radical transparency, and robust good health. As Secretary Kennedy said, \\'The AI revolution has arrived.\\'\" Kennedy has criticized the HHS\\'s vaccine program and also fired thousands of staff since taking the helm of the agency. Many top Centers for Disease Control and Prevention staff members have also left their roles in protest of Kennedy\\'s policies, with the new director announced as O\\'Neill, who previously worked for conservative billionaire Peter Thiel . Newsweek reached out to the HHS for comment via email. What People Are Saying In a September 3 letter, a group of current and former HHS employees wrote: \"We warn the President, Congress , and the Public that Secretary Kennedy\\'s actions are compromising the health of this nation, and we demand Secretary Kennedy\\'s resignation.\" HHS Communications Director Andrew Nixon previously said: \"From his first day in office, [Kennedy] pledged to check his assumptions at the door—and he asked every HHS colleague to do the same. That commitment to evidence-based science is why, in just seven months, he and the HHS team have accomplished more than any health secretary in history in the fight to end the chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again.\" Alex Beene, a financial literacy instructor for the University of Tennessee at Martin, told Newsweek : \"Kennedy\\'s approach is similar to some other leadership in the new administration that are looking to advance customer service and inner-department communication by employing artificial intelligence. On the surface, this seems like a step forward and could boost the output of the agency. At the same point, skeptics are concerned this could lead to dramatic reduction in workforce and eventually take its toll on the services offered. Kevin Thompson, the CEO of 9i Capital Group and the host of the 9innings podcast, told Newsweek : \"ChatGPT is only as good as the people supplying the input. If those providing the input don\\'t truly understand the information, the results can be misleading and even harmful. I\\'m deeply concerned about how this could impact services moving forward, especially if the people using ChatGPT don\\'t have a clear grasp of the very services they\\'re deploying.\" What Happens Next Beene said it remains unclear how AI will affect the agency for better or worse, whether it increases efficiency or leads to lower quality services and job cuts. \"Ultimately, it will be up to HHS to demonstrate AI is net positive through better, more reliable service and hopefully not sacrificing many roles the department currently has,\" Beene said.', 'pubDate': '2025-09-10 21:37:48', 'pubDateTZ': 'UTC', 'image_url': 'https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2720109/rfk-jr.jpg', 'video_url': None, 'source_id': 'newsweek', 'source_name': 'Newsweek', 'source_priority': 2129, 'source_url': 'https://www.newsweek.com', 'source_icon': 'https://n.bytvi.com/newsweek.png', 'language': 'english', 'country': ['united states of america'], 'category': ['technology', 'top'], 'sentiment': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'sentiment_stats': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_tag': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_region': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_org': 'ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS', 'ai_summary': \"Robert F Kennedy Jr., the new HHS Secretary, has ordered all HHS employees to use ChatGPT, as reported by 404 Media and Gizmodo.

            "Nagpur: The first meeting of the Maharashtra cabinet subcommittee on Other Backward Classes (OBCs) underscored that no injustice will be meted out to the community, but only verified claims of Marathas having genuine Kunbi records will be entertained. Revenue Minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule, who heads the panel, in a statement to media stated that there is an apprehension among OBCs that they may face injustice, \"but this will not happen\". \"Only those with proper Kunbi records will be issued certificates as per the govt resolution. Verification will be done through documents, genealogy, and reports from village committees and the tehsildar's office,\" Bawankule said. The meeting held at Mantralaya in Mumbai was attended by ministers including Chhagan Bhujbal, Ganesh Naik, Sanjay Rathod, Pankaja Munde, Atul Save and Dattatray Bharne, along with officials. Bawankule highlighted that the state's OBC population spans 353 castes, many of whom await their share of Rs3,688 crore in pending funds, including Rs1,200 crore in scholarships. \"These scholarships must be expedited, and facilities such as hostels and office spaces must be arranged,\" he said. Concerns over misuse of documentation were also raised. \"While issuing Kunbi-Maratha certificates, only genuine claims should be considered,\" Bawankule said. Several ministers voiced their stand; Bhujbal questioned the adequacy of funds allocated to OBC welfare and urged the finance department to release them promptly for education and hostels. Munde stressed that reservation should be based on authentic documents. A proposal was also tabled to model a loan distribution scheme after the Annasaheb Patil Development Corporation to assist OBC youth with employment and entrepreneurship opportunities. The subcommittee's recommendations aim to ensure transparency while protecting the community's rights, with strict scrutiny of claims and documents being a key pillar of the initiative, Bawankule said. # OBC WELFARE PANEL STAND - Don't include Maratha community in OBC category, and don't issue Kunbi certificates indiscriminately to all Marathas - Provide OBC students 100% scholarships for professional courses - Increase scholarships for higher education abroad from 75 to 200 - Quota for OBCs in housing schemes by Mhada and CIDCO - Rename OBC Economic Development Corporation ‘Advocate Janardan Patil OBC Economic Development Corporation' - Set-up well-equipped libraries at city and taluka levels for OBC, VJNT, and SBC students - Institute Dr Panjabrao Deshmukh OBC Social Service Award to recognise outstanding contributions - Provide state schemes for farmers belonging to OBC, VJNT, SBC, and special backward categories with 100% subsidies similar to those available for Scheduled Castes and Tribes. - Make provision of Rs1,000 crore to the OBC Economic Development Corporation to enhance welfare initiatives ‘Thackeray cousins uniting for family, political reasons' To a query, Bawankule said the coming together of cousins Uddhav Thackeray and Raj Thackeray is a welcome development. \"It is good that they are united through family ties and kinship. Though political differences created distance earlier, coming together now for political reasons is nothing to be frowned upon,\" he said. He urged both to contest elections in their own way, while affirming that the Mahayuti alliance would face them through its collective platform. \n",

            "Megan Jastrab (Picnic-PostNL) not only surpassed her original goal of raising $10,000 to assist junior women from the United States, she added a chunk of extra change from her success at the Simac Ladies Tour as well. Earlier this year, there was a chance only two of four quota spots for junior women would be filled for Team USA at the UCI Road World Championships in Kigali, Rwanda. There was no shortage of talent, only money. Now thanks to the former junior world champion , her crowdfunding campaign has generated $15,111, as of September 9, and will be distributed evenly to four young riders - Lidia Cusack, Liliana Edwards, Alyssa Sarkisov and Alexis Jaramillo. \"It'd be a shame if two of the girls have potential and miss out, just because of funding. So that's when I was like, 'Let's put it out there'. Donating my prize money, at least I can fund one junior,\" Jastrab told Cyclingnews about her idea to raise money. \"Then we opened it up [with crowdfunding] and it's up to $15,000. It's encouraging to see.\" This year's Road Worlds, September 21-27, will be hosted on the continent of Africa for the first time. It's a positive for Rwanda in the history books, but also an expensive proposition for many riders from around the world. The Danish cycling federation will not send any junior or under-23 riders because of costs, and will only send elites for road races. \"Megan was aware that a trip to Africa would be particularly expensive and saw an opportunity to help alleviate financial stress for athletes, with a particular interest in supporting the Junior Women,\" a spokesperson for USA Cycling told Cyclingnews . \"The money Megan has raised is being split evenly across the junior women to offset the expenses associated with the trip. It’s a testimony to Megan’s passion and heart for the sport and upcoming generations of cyclists.\" Cusack, who won Druivenkoers-Overijse junior race two week ago, and Edwards, the US junior ITT national champion, will race the 18.3km time trial on September 23. They will be joined in the road race four days later by Sarkisov, the US junior road race national champion, and Jaramillo, the silver medalist at nationals in the road race. Cusack and Sarkisov also finished top 10 for junior women at the 2025 Cyclocross World Championships. Jastrab said she was offered a spot to race Worlds in Switzerland last year, which would have required her to pay a fee and cover her own travel as an elite rider. While she declined the spot because the course was not suited for her, it caused consternation that any level of rider could have dreams dashed to test themselves at the highest level because of dollars and cents, not ability. \"As an organisation, I don't think that USA Cycling has the funding for every category, every discipline, for every trip. So my manager and I, we put together a proposal for a scholarship, that would be in the spring for juniors selected for the spring trip to race Nation's Cups. I wanted to help, as it's their first experience in Europe and allows you to qualify for Worlds,\" Jastrab said as she explained what sparked her to help with the funding of young US riders. \"With a scholarship, it would also come with mentorship, so I would give my time and make it more educational. Then it was delayed and delayed.\" The California native said it was a conversation with USA Cycling's Tanner Putt, director of women's juniors, that turned the spark into a flame, that resulted in the launch of a GoFundMe page, given he said they had four quota spots but could maybe send only two because of costs. She also pledged to donate her own prize money and the bank account received a big bump on Sunday after she finished third overall at the Simac Ladies Tour, with a pair of podiums on early stages in the Netherlands. It was her best result of her career at a stage race. \"I did the Giro and the Tour and came out of the Tour pretty tired. I had a really big training week [prior to Simac] which my body was not responding to, so I raced in Plouay two days before Simac and I was just suffering a lot. I just felt so dead to the world. I was a bit worried starting Simac, and the first stage did not go well,\" she told Cyclingnews from the Netherlands. \"So then to turn it around in the second stage, make the first echelon and then sprint to third, and then in the third stage sprint to second, yeah, it's really crazy.\" She was passed by Elisa Balsamo (Lidl-Trek) for the middle GC spot after the time trial on the fifth day, but finished fifth in the bunch sprint on the final stage to secure third overall. That finish also became the biggest points haul for the Picnic-PostNL team so far this season, 160 in one swoop, delivering big rewards for the team as well as the junior women's fund raising. Jastrab know all too well the importance of opportunities in the early years of the development pathway, earning three junior world titles in 2019, two on the track and one on the road. She also owns 27 national titles across multiple disciplines, and earned a bronze medal at the Tokyo Olympic Games as part of the Team Pursuit squad. At these Road World Championship, Jastrab will be just a fan, and watch on her TV. For next year, she said she'd still like to set up a scholarship, and is open to help from sponsors. \"I'm excited to watch Worlds. I'll be cheering from afar,\" said Jastrab, who through the process has become even more invested in the outcome of the junior events. \"So I think it's just exciting to see their opportunity. Also to race World Championships, they're with the elites, the U23s, everything, it's exciting to watch.\" Subscribe to Cyclingnews to unlock unlimited access to our coverage of the first-ever UCI Road World Championships on African soil.

            "Lucknow: The 68th convocation of Lucknow University witnessed not only Indian achievers but also international scholars who brought pride to their nations and the institution alike. Among them was Abdulkafi Abdullah Ghaleb Ahmed Al-Rafaei from Yemen, who was awarded three medals. Abdulkafi topped the MA in Arabic and received medals for being the best student across all subjects in the programme. Speaking about his journey, Abdulkafi shared that he worked as an Arabic teacher in Yemen before joining Lucknow University to pursue higher studies in Arabic Literature and Oriental Studies. However, due to the ongoing conflict in Yemen, where recent attacks took place, attending the convocation in person was not possible for him. \"Arabic is my mother tongue, so studying the subject in depth felt natural to me, but I wanted to step outside my country to seek new perspectives. Coming to India was one of the best decisions I made, as it gave me both academic guidance and cultural understanding,\" he said. Another international achiever was Kijung Jang from South Korea, who secured a medal in Linguistics. She enrolled at Lucknow University in 2023 after arriving in India during the COVID-19 pandemic with her husband, who started a business here. Formerly a language trainer in South Korea, Jang found her academic calling in linguistics. After completing her course, she will return to South Korea. \"As a language trainer back in South Korea, I thought I already found my path, but Lucknow University helped me rediscover my passion for linguistics. This medal is proof that embracing change and stepping into the unknown can sometimes lead to the most rewarding journeys,\" she said. From Sri Lanka, Hawa Kalu Annakkage Venura Dishanka De Silva emerged as the topper from the College of Fine Arts, earning the Best PG Student medal in Visual Arts. He recalled how an ICCR scholarship enabled him to join Lucknow University. \"I lost my parents when I was very young, and life could have easily taken a very different turn for me. But my two elder sisters stood like a rock, ensuring I continued my education despite all the odds. When I received the ICCR scholarship, it felt like the world opened its doors to me. At Lucknow University, the training, exposure, and encouragement I received shaped me not only as an artist but also as a person,\" he said. \n",

            "PETALING JAYA : Malaysia must boost digital literacy and embed local hotlines into social media platforms to shield youths from rising suicide-related risks, says an expert. As the world marked World Suicide Prevention Day yesterday, the occasion serves as a reminder that protecting youths requires not only systemic support but also everyday conversations at home, in schools and online. Universiti Teknologi Mara Communication and Media Studies Faculty senior lecturer Dr Hamizah Sahharon said many Malaysians remain unaware of these dangers or how to protect themselves, leaving youths especially vulnerable. She emphasised the need for digital literacy education among young people, parents and teachers as online risks such as cyberbullying, scams, grooming and privacy breaches grow. “To help young people stay safe online, digital literacy programmes must be youth-centred, practical and collaborative. The Malaysian Youth Mental Health Index 2023 (MyMHI’23) shows that youths use positive coping strategies such as leisure activities, worship and outdoor pursuits, with family support acting as a strong protective factor. “External evidence highlights the need for early, continuous digital education in schools, co-designed with youth to keep it relevant and empowering, especially for vulnerable groups.” She also said youths face rising exposure to suicide-related content online, with studies showing 13.7% were cyberbullying victims, 17.1% engaged in suicidal behaviours and suicide attempts among adolescents climbing to 6.9%, often linked to bullying. She added that the Covid-19 pandemic heightened vulnerability as more young people went online, where social media acted as both a risk and a resource. “Analyses of Malaysian X (formerly Twitter) activity revealed frequent suicide-related posts, ranging from awareness and government criticism to direct expressions of suicidal feelings. “MyMHI’23 also shows youths are highly engaged with social media, with 21.8% feeling upset and 17.1% demotivated when posts failed to attract likes or positive comments. Their mental health is tied to online validation, making them vulnerable when harmful content spreads.” Hamizah said such content circulates quickly through social media, messaging apps and private groups, especially at night, on weekends and during school holidays when teens are most active. It ranges from self-harm and suicide posts to eating disorders, risky behaviour, hate speech and fake news, often stumbled upon unintentionally. “Key stressors such as social expectations, body image and achievement pressures are amplified online. Harmful content on beauty standards, academic struggles and ‘success culture’ thrives, often resurfacing during exam periods or in peer groups that migrate to WhatsApp or Telegram after moderation.” Risks increase with longer screen time, chatting with strangers and a sense of “freedom” online, particularly for youths already under stress. Content is often shared impulsively when it becomes popular or is forwarded by trusted friends. She added that many adolescents communicate suicidal intentions indirectly through diaries, memos or online posts, with about half who die by suicide leaving notes or digital clues, often mistaken for teenage moodiness or academic stress. “Evidence shows youths benefit when parents and peers are equipped to discuss risks and build resilience through trust-based approaches, unlike secretive monitoring that undermines trust. “Keeping young people safe online is not about spying on them. It works better to build trust, teach skills and give them more control.” \n",

            "Olusegun AdeniyiThe past two weeks have been tough for me health wise, but I appreciate all those who have either called or sent messages. I also thank God for His mercies. I am getting better. I couldn’t write this column last week and I had neither the motivation nor the presence of mind to do so this week either. But I noticed last night that the 2025 ‘World Suicide Prevention Day’ (10th September every year) passed us by in Nigeria without much awareness about an affliction that takes the lives of several of our citizens almost on daily basis. Meanwhile, Nigeria remains one of the few countries in the world where attempted suicide is still treated as a criminal offence under both Section 327 of the Criminal Code Act and Section 231 of the Penal Code Act. As a reminder of the challenge at hand, I am republishing an abridged version of a column I wrote on the issue six years ago.On that occasion, Ireminded readers of the immortal words of David O. McKay: “The most important of life’s battles is the one we fight daily in the silent chambers of the soul.”Following the death in March 2017 of a medical doctor who jumped headlong into the lagoon off Third Mainland Bridge in Lagos, I argued on this page that because some wounds can easily be covered up, we do not always know what people around us are going through or what action they might take when pushed to the edge. I used a two-minute Youtube clip titled ‘Silent Battles’ to illustrate my point in a piece titled ‘The Silent Battles of Life’. Recent developments in our country indicate that many of our citizens do indeed need help without knowing where to turn. That makes them susceptible to depression, a state that has been described as being surrounded by a thousand people yet feeling completely alone.A 25-year-old graduate of Madonna University returned home from the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) scheme to stab himself to death, following signs of depression which his parents noticed and actually did all they could to help. A night guard at the Ekiti state scholarship board hanged himself with clothing material tied to the railing of a building at the ministry of education, after telling his sister-in-law that he was tired of life. A middle-aged man walked into the premises of Wema Bank in the Sango area of Ibadan, stripped naked, climbed the network mast and jumped to his death. A 400-level student of the Department of English and Literary Studies, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, (UNN) posted a revealing suicide note on his Facebook wall and then drank two bottles of ‘Sniper’ to end it all. Faced with the prospect of being withdrawn from the Niger Delta University, a medical student plunged into a river in Ammasoma, Bayelsa State.From failing examinations to being dumped by a lover to desperation resulting from the biting economic situation or health complications and peer pressure, far too many Nigerians are reaching their breaking point and taking their own lives through various means. And if there is anything that recent tragedies have taught, it is that there are many otherwise normal people who nurse a feeling of emptiness and despair that could in turn trigger what is almost becoming an epidemic in our country. More worrisome is that there is now a body of research that suicide can indeed be contagious with the reported death of one person contributing to such decision by others. In her thesis on this issue, Dr Madelyn Gould puts the blame partly on the media. Even in our country, you see in some publications distasteful photographs of victims dangling on the rope. “Media coverage of suicides has been shown to significantly increase the rate of suicide, and the magnitude of the increase is related to the amount, duration, and prominence of coverage”, said Gould.Suicide of course is not peculiar to Nigeria. It is a global challenge. In the last 45 years, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), suicide rates have increased by 60 percent globally and now a leading cause of death among young people–the group at highest risk in a third of all countries. In the US, according to the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, suicide is the third leading cause of death among people between the age of 15 and 24 while, going by WHO estimates, nearly 30 percent of all suicides worldwide occur in India and China.In South Korea, Japan and the Asia-Pacific region, suicide is also the leading cause of death among young people. In fact, a recent government report says that more Japanese children and teenagers killed themselves between 2016 and 2017 than in any year since 1986. “We’d love to eliminate such tragedies altogether, but the reality is several hundred children are taking their lives (each year),” an education ministry official reportedly said. “It’s important to teach children how to get help as soon as possible ... because it becomes harder and harder to find help once they’re already suffering. The light at the end of the tunnel gets darker and darker until they begin to start seeing the light at the end of the tunnel as death.”The president of the association of psychiatrists of Nigeria, Dr Taiwo Sheikh, recently put the number of psychiatrists in Nigeria at about 250. “We are training psychiatrists, both at the West African College of Physicians and the National Postgraduate Medical College, but three out of every five psychiatrists we produce leave the country for greener pastures. One major thing that is eating the field of mental health is brain drain”, he told PUNCH newspaper which did a detailed report on suicide cases in Nigeria. The implication is that even for those who want to seek help, there may be nowhere to go in a nation that has ‘surplus doctors’. But it is also reassuring that many Nigerians are now speaking out on how those going through any form of stress, personal losses, heartbreak, frustration, grief or experiencing depression can be helped. We need an urgent national conversation on mental ill-health which might be more prevalent than we imagine because the system makes it difficult for people to even acknowledge they have such challenges to avoid stigmatization.The most famous psychiatric hospital in the country is in Aro, Abeokuta, Ogun State. Yet, ‘Aro’ or ‘Aromental’ has for decades been the name with which we tag anybody who may have issues that ordinarily deserve a duty of care. Also, because there is no support system, many cannot optimize their potentials. So, beyond counting the body-bags of suicide victims, we need to de-stigmatize the challenge of mental ill-health.In October 2015, the ‘New York Times’ published a lengthy feature story titled, ‘The Chains of Mental Illness in West Africa’ which speaks to how countries within the sub-region, including Nigeria, maltreat people with mental ill-health. We see it on the streets of major cities in Nigeria where people who ordinarily should be helped are paraded in chains. “Every society struggles to care for people with mental illness. In parts of West Africa, where psychiatry is virtually unknown, the chain is often a last resort for desperate families who cannot control a loved one in the grip of psychosis. Religious retreats, known as prayer camps, set up makeshift psychiatric wards, usually with prayer as the only intervention,” wrote New York Times in the report which also revealed that “at last count, Liberia had just one practicing psychiatrist. Niger had three, Togo four and Benin seven. Sierra Leone had none.” The report also stated: “Surveys, like one by psychiatrists at the University of Ibadan in Nigeria, put the prevalence of schizophrenia, characterized by hallucinations and delusions, at 0.5 to 2.5 percent, roughly the same as the global prevalence. That is at least a million people in countries where chaining is common, like Togo, Ghana and Nigeria.”In contrast to how we deal with mental ill-health, especially in Nigeria, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) last Sunday aired a special programme titled, ‘A Royal Team Talk: Tackling Mental Health’ in which the Duke of Cambridge, Prince Williams had a roundtable discussion on a football field with Thierry Henry, Gareth Southgate, Danny Rose, Jermaine Jenas and Peter Crouch on depression and suicide. “Men are the hardest-to-reach audience on the subject of mental health. Suicide is the biggest killer of young men under the age of 45”, said Prince Williams who also shared his own harrowing experience following the death of his mother, Princess Diana, which he described as a “pain like no other pain”.If there is any lesson from recent tragedies, it is that we should be sensitive in how we respond to the plights of others, even in the social media. Although the concern of Dr Robert Brandt was more about professional colleagues in the field of medicine in his piece, “Silent Battles that cannot be Won Alone”, his admonition is nonetheless useful for us all: “I know from multiple friends who have been in that dark place that healing often starts with finding a person who will listen to them. Spouting advice and saying ‘just get over it’ cures nothing. Be kind and listen, truly listen. It can be the start of the healing process.”The Mentally Aware Nigeria Initiative (MANI) and other similar non-profit organisations can be found online, raising awareness on mental health issues in our country and how people can be helped. But sometimes the choice as to whether to carry on or give up is ours to make. In the difficult times in which we live, it is easy to yield to some dark inner pressure when confronted with problems for which we have no immediate solution. In such moments, we must always remember that life, as one writer aptly captured it, is not about waiting for the storm to pass, “it’s about learning how to dance in the rain.”You can follow me on my X (formerly Twitter) handle, @Olusegunverdictand on www.olusegunadeniyi.comThe post Let’s Talk About Suicides appeared first on THISDAYLIVE. \n",

Security and compliance must come first, because customers deserve to feel protected. But beyond that, we must make financial tools simple, accessible, and truly accessible for every Nigerian, no matter their background,” Melah noted.He emphasised that simplicity remained central to adoption, particularly in regions where financial literacy remains low. For PalmPay, this means designing an intuitive platform that allows its 40 million customers to navigate with ease.The post PalmPay Champions Local Partnerships, Trust at GITEX Nigeria 2025 appeared first on THISDAYLIVE. \n",

            "Australia and New Zealand are Hosting New Groundbreaking Technologies to Reshape their Tourism Sectors in 2026In 2026, both Australia and New Zealand are poised to introduce a host of groundbreaking technologies designed to reshape their tourism sectors. These government-backed initiatives will leverage the latest advancements in digital tools and infrastructure to enhance travel experiences, improve sustainability, and ensure regional growth. From AI-driven services to sustainable travel innovations, these countries are paving the way for a smarter, more inclusive future in tourism.Australia’s Digital Tourism and Innovation LandscapeTourism Technology and Innovation RoadmapIn Australia, Queensland is leading the charge with the development of its Tourism Technology and Innovation Roadmap. The initiative aims to support tourism businesses in embracing emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and satellite connectivity. By adopting these technologies, Queensland intends to enhance service delivery, increase efficiency, and reduce the environmental footprint of tourism activities. The roadmap is designed to make tourism in the region more sustainable and capable of adapting to the digital age, allowing businesses to stay ahead of global trends and meet the evolving needs of travelers.A major focus of this initiative is the integration of data-driven strategies to streamline tourism operations. AI and machine learning tools will help businesses better understand customer preferences, enabling personalized travel experiences. Furthermore, satellite technologies will support sustainable tourism management by providing real-time data to monitor environmental impact and optimize resource usage.CountryTechnologyCategoryDescriptionSourceAustraliaTourism Technology and Innovation RoadmapDigital TransformationDevelopment of AI and satellite connectivity for tourism businesses, focusing on sustainability and service delivery.qld.gov.auAustraliaFirst Nations Digital Inclusion RoadmapDigital InclusionAimed at improving connectivity and digital skills among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.digitalinclusion.gov.auAustraliaDigital Health Strategic VisionHealth TechnologyIntegration of telehealth services, patient portals, and data-driven decision-making to improve healthcare in tourism areas.health.qld.gov.auNew ZealandTourism Growth RoadmapTourism InfrastructureInitiatives to enhance international visitor numbers, regional tourism, and technology-driven tourism infrastructure.mbie.govt.nzNew ZealandE-Bike Charging StationsSustainable TourismInstallation of e-bike charging stations along cycle trails to promote eco-friendly travel and regional tourism.beehive.govt.nzNew ZealandDigital Identity Verification AppTravel ConvenienceA mobile app to verify international digital credentials, simplifying and securing the travel experience.beehive.govt.nzNew ZealandAdvanced Technology PlatformInfrastructure DevelopmentInvestments in cryogenics, superconductors, and materials science to support tourism infrastructure improvements.mbie.govt.nzFirst Nations Digital Inclusion RoadmapAnother pivotal initiative in Australia is the First Nations Digital Inclusion Roadmap, which focuses on promoting digital literacy and inclusion among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. Scheduled for completion by 2026, the roadmap is a significant step toward bridging the digital divide, ensuring that all Australians, regardless of their background or location, can benefit from technological advancements in tourism.This roadmap is part of Australia’s broader efforts to promote regional equality. By increasing access to digital tools and infrastructure, the initiative will empower First Nations communities to engage more fully in the tourism industry. It will provide local tourism operators with the resources to reach a wider audience, contributing to economic growth and fostering cultural exchange.Digital Health Strategic VisionQueensland’s digital health transformation also plays a key role in tourism innovation. The Digital Health Strategic Vision is expected to have a profound impact on travel, particularly in health-conscious tourism. With telehealth services, digital patient portals, and a more connected healthcare system, tourists visiting Queensland will experience improved health services during their travels. This initiative also focuses on making healthcare more accessible to tourists, ensuring that travelers can receive timely medical assistance through digital platforms, enhancing their overall experience in the region.New Zealand’s Smart Tourism and Infrastructure InnovationsTourism Growth RoadmapNew Zealand is equally committed to advancing its tourism sector through technology. The government’s Tourism Growth Roadmap sets a clear direction for the future of the country’s tourism industry. By 2026, New Zealand aims to establish itself as a leader in smart tourism, using innovative technologies to enhance visitor experiences, promote sustainability, and improve infrastructure. This roadmap aligns with the country’s broader goals of fostering inclusive economic growth and ensuring that tourism benefits all regions equally.Key elements of the roadmap include the development of smarter infrastructure systems for tourism hubs, such as smart airports, digital visitor information points, and eco-friendly accommodation options. By incorporating these technologies, New Zealand will offer tourists seamless, sustainable, and more enjoyable experiences. The focus on regional tourism will also help distribute the economic benefits of travel across the country, reducing pressure on traditional tourist hotspots.E-Bike Charging Stations for Sustainable TravelNew Zealand’s commitment to sustainable tourism is highlighted by the introduction of E-Bike Charging Stations along popular cycling trails. These stations are part of a broader strategy to encourage eco-friendly travel, providing tourists with the facilities needed to explore New Zealand’s stunning landscapes using electric bikes. By 2026, the government aims to create a comprehensive network of charging stations, making it easier for travelers to embark on green journeys and enjoy New Zealand’s natural beauty while minimizing their carbon footprint.The project also supports local economies by promoting rural tourism. Cyclists often visit lesser-known towns and regions, helping to boost small businesses and create jobs in these areas. This initiative is a win-win for both the environment and local communities, contributing to New Zealand’s vision of a sustainable tourism model.Digital Identity Verification AppAnother significant technological development in New Zealand is the launch of a Digital Identity Verification App, expected to streamline the visitor experience. This app allows tourists to verify their digital credentials, such as travel documents and health certifications, making it easier and quicker to enter the country. By eliminating the need for physical verification at borders and immigration checkpoints, the app will reduce waiting times, improve efficiency, and enhance the overall travel experience for international visitors.The app’s rollout is part of a larger effort to modernize travel infrastructure, incorporating cutting-edge technologies to facilitate smoother and safer travel for tourists. This development is particularly crucial for New Zealand, given the growing number of international travelers, and will make the country more accessible to tourists from around the world.Advanced Technology for Tourism InfrastructureIn addition to the digital tools mentioned above, New Zealand is investing in advanced technologies such as cryogenics, superconductors, and materials science, which are indirectly benefiting tourism infrastructure. These technologies are being deployed to improve the country’s space, aviation, and clean processing sectors, all of which can contribute to the growth of the tourism industry. For instance, advancements in aerospace technologies could lead to better air travel options for visitors, while clean processing methods may improve environmental sustainability in tourism-related operations.Looking Ahead to 2026: A Future Shaped by TechnologyBoth Australia and New Zealand are committed to using technology to not only enhance the travel experience but also address pressing challenges like sustainability and digital inclusion. By 2026, the tourism landscapes in these countries will be vastly different, with smarter, greener, and more accessible systems that cater to the needs of modern travelers. Whether it’s through AI-powered services, eco-friendly travel options, or more inclusive digital tools, both nations are setting the stage for a future where technology drives tourism forward in exciting new ways.As these technologies come to life, they will not only transform how tourists experience both countries but also help generate economic growth, promote regional development, and create new opportunities for local communities.

            "HT Correspondent SANGRAM, Sept 10: In a bid to promote human rights awareness and strengthen community engagement, the Arunachal Pradesh State Human Rights Commission (APSHRC) has launched a three-day Human Rights Awareness Outreach Programme in Kurung Kumey District, beginning at Sangram. According to an official statement, the initiative, led by Bamang Tago, Chairperson of APSHRC, aims to educate citizens about their rights and the mechanisms available to protect them. The programme has brought together a wide array of stakeholders, including Gaon Buras, Panchayat leaders, educators, representatives from non-governmental organisations, women’s groups, legal practitioners, human rights activists, district administration officials, and youth representatives. The diverse participation reflects a collective effort to spread awareness and foster a rights-based culture in the district. During the inaugural session, Bamang Tago delivered the keynote address, in which he provided a historical overview of the Arunachal Pradesh Human Rights Commission. He elaborated on the commission’s role in addressing human rights violations and safeguarding the interests of vulnerable populations. He highlighted the responsibility of citizens, civil society, and administrative bodies in ensuring that the rights guaranteed under the law are effectively upheld. The outreach team was accompanied by Adv Taba Zim, Chairperson of the Child Welfare Committee, who elaborated on the critical role played by the Child Welfare Committee in protecting the rights of children and ensuring their well-being. She emphasised the need for collective action to address child-related rights violations and create an enabling environment for their growth and development. Adding to the programme, Bamang Kaku, Coordinator of Arunachal Citizen Rights, conducted a session on raising awareness about HIV and substance abuse. She highlighted the challenges faced by communities and the importance of sensitizing the public about health-related rights and support systems available to individuals affected by these issues. Joel Angu, Research Officer of APSHRC, provided participants with a detailed account of the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993. He explained the legislative framework and underscored the importance of human rights education in empowering citizens to claim and defend their rights. He further spoke about the proactive role the commission plays in addressing grievances and promoting legal literacy. The official statement emphasized that the programme is being conducted in collaboration with Arunachal Citizen Rights, underscoring the joint effort to enhance human rights awareness at the grassroots level. Through this initiative, APSHRC aims to build stronger networks, encourage dialogue, and equip communities with the knowledge required to uphold human dignity and justice. The three-day programme is expected to reach a wider audience across the district, fostering partnerships and reinforcing the state’s commitment to creating a society that values equality, justice, and respect for human rights. \n",

            "Emma OkonjiZoho, a global technology company, recently released a new research report, which revealed that Nigerian businesses are setting a global standard in balancing Artificial Intelligence (AI) adoption with robust privacy protection.The study titled: ‘The AI Privacy Equation: The Nigerian Model of Responsible AI Adoption’, was conducted by Arion Research on behalf of Zoho.The company also said it saw a customer growth of 75 per cent in 2024 in Nigeria, one of its key markets in the African region.Zoho made the two key announcements on the sidelines of Zoholics Nigeria, the company’s annual user conference, which held recently in Lagos. Speaking at a press conference, Country Head, Zoho Nigeria, Mr. Kehinde Ogundare, said: “We continue to invest in Nigeria as businesses here accelerate their adoption of technology to grow and scale. The latest study around AI and Privacy proves that Nigerian businesses are leading the way in responsible AI adoption, as they temper the new technology with privacy measures. This mirrors Zoho’s philosophy of building contextual and privacy-first AI models that can help businesses realise tangible benefits. We infuse our AI solutions—from conversational and prescriptive to agentic and generative—with business context so that it can provide organisations with decision intelligence.”The report, which surveyed 386 respondents in Nigeria, reveals that 93 per cent of Nigerian organisations have already begun their AI journey, with 31 per cent achieving advanced AI integration across the organisation, and 26.5 per cent implementing AI across multiple departments. This indicates that more than half of Nigerian businesses have moved from an experimental phase to operational deployment of AI. Furthermore, 84 per cent of the respondents report strengthening privacy measures since implementing AI, with 66 per cent describing these improvements as significant, the report said.According to the report, the widespread adoption is being driven by executive commitment at the highest levels, as more than half of the respondents occupy CEO or executive roles, and this leadership-driven approach is accelerating adoption and moving companies quickly from pilots to full-scale deployment. The study found that Nigerian businesses are not just adopting AI, they are embedding it responsibly.The report further said 94 per cent of organisations now have a dedicated privacy officer or team, a figure well above global averages. “In fact, 40 per cent of the organisations allocate more than 30 per cent of their IT budgets specifically to privacy protection, reflecting the belief that strong governance is a competitive advantage rather than constraint,” the report further said.The financial sector, according to the report, is pioneering the balance between innovation and compliance, representing 29 per cent of the respondents. Their top AI use cases for them include customer service automation (49 per cent), software development and enhancement (46 per cent), and marketing optimisation (32 per cent), each implemented with privacy-by-design principles at the core. Addressing AI upskilling and barriers, the report said while the lack of technical expertise was cited as the top-most barrier by 37 per cent of the businesses, privacy and security concerns were the next biggest challenge, cited by 35 per cent of the respondents, adding that skills development is, therefore, a defining feature of the Nigerian model, with 69 per cent of organisations prioritising data analysis and interpretation skills, 53 per cent emphasising on AI literacy, and 40 per cent of organisations investing in prompt engineering skills for generative AI tools. The report noted that Nigerian organisations recognised that AI success depends more on human capability development than technology acquisition.

            "​​​Emma OkonjiThe International Telecommunications Union (ITU), the United Nations specialised agency for global digital technology development, has said it will cost an investment plan of between $2.6 and $2.8 trillion to achieve a universal and meaningful Internet connectivity by 2030, based on current market prices.ITU derived the whopping $2.8 trillion investment plan from a report it released recently in collaboration with the Communications, Space & Technology Commission (CST) of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.The report, titled: ‘Connecting Humanity Action Blueprint’, outlines the challenges, projected costs, and collaborative strategies needed to make sure everyone, everywhere, can use the Internet, including the estimated one-third of humanity currently offline. According to the report, the largest investment component of $1.5 trillion to $ 1.7 trillion is required for hard infrastructure, alongside substantial funding for human and institutional capacity, mainly in developing countries.Giving details of the report, ITU Secretary-General, Doreen Bogdan-Martin, said: “Digital connectivity means creating opportunities for education, jobs, and access to essential services that can transform lives and communities. While significant resources are needed to meaningfully connect everyone, these are investments that will contribute to a prosperous digital future for all.”Acting Governor of CST, Haytham AlOhali, said: “The world needs between $ 2.6 trillion and $ 2.8 trillion to connect humanity by 2030. This figure is nearly five times higher than the last assessment conducted in 2020 in partnership with ITU during the Saudi chairmanship of the G20. Such a dramatic increase underscores the urgency for international cooperation, collective investment, and the sharing of expertise if we are to achieve the vision of universal, meaningful connectivity for all.”Highlighting the challenges of connecting billions of people globally, ITU estimates that 2.6 billion people are still excluded from the digital world, with connectivity closely linked to levels of socio-economic development. In 2024, an estimated 93 per cent of the population in high-income countries was using the Internet, compared to just 27 per cent in low-income countries.The new report on achieving universal meaningful connectivity builds on ITU’s original 2020 Connecting Humanity study, published under the direction of the G20 during the presidency of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, by identifying critical gaps with the anticipated costs for addressing them. ​According to the report, a breakdown of the $2.8 trillion investment cost, shows that deploying broadband networks such as 4G fixed wireless in rural regions and satellites in the most remote locations and in underserved populations, represents the single largest cost of between $1.5 and $1.7 trillion.Affordability represents $983 billion to reduce the cost of smartphones and broadband services for both fixed and mobile, which according to the report, is vital so that individuals and households worldwide, particularly in lower-income regions, can afford to connect and stay online.Digital skills represents $152 billion to boost the effective use of the Internet, since connectivity alone is not enough, as people must have the skills to use the Internet effectively. Investments to fund large-scale digital literacy initiatives can empower individuals to access online education, secure better jobs, and actively participate in a digitally-driven society, the report said.Policy and regulation represents $ 600 million to modernise regulations and create predictable policy environments worldwide, that will unlock efficiencies and promote innovation. While this represents the smallest cost component, it holds back digital transformation and sustains the other gaps. The impact of closing it would be massive, according to the report.The report however said public-private collaboration would be needed to achieve the five-year investment plan on global Internet connectivity.As the ‘Connecting Humanity Action Blueprint’ highlights, global progress on connectivity has been uneven, with the world’s 46 least-developed countries lagging significantly due to financing barriers, limited technical expertise, and unreliable infrastructure.To address the challenges, ITU has called for innovative business approaches and renewed collaboration between governments, the tech industry, development finance institutions, and civil society, to close current divides and prevent future ones, particularly in fields like Artificial Intelligence (AI).The report recommended the use of schools as gateways to Internet access to accelerate digital inclusion worldwide, including investing in energy infrastructure in Africa, and enhancing data collection at the sub-national level.The post Report: Achieving Global Internet Connectivity by 2030 Will Require $2.8trn Investment appeared first on THISDAYLIVE. \n",

            "A new partnership focused on a popular snack nut will offer exciting opportunities for students, research potential for faculty and the latest technology for farmers. Representatives of the University of California and the Almond Board of California signed a memorandum of understanding, or MOU, at the UC Merced campus on Sept. 10. The MOU calls for the entities to work together over the next five years in such vital areas as automation, sustainability and new almond varieties. Josette Lewis, vice president and scientific chief of the Almond Board, said the agreement between her organization and UC Merced and UC Agriculture and Natural Resources “marks a new chapter for our industry and our communities. Together, we are laying the foundation for a future where almond production is not only more productive, but also more resilient and sustainable.” The Almond Board of California is an industry organization dedicated to promoting California almonds to a domestic and international audience through marketing efforts and by funding and promoting studies about almonds' health benefits, as well as ensuring sustainable agricultural practices and food safety. The MOU is the culmination of discussions that began several years ago, Chancellor Juan Sánchez Muñoz said. “I’m delighted that we’re here,” the chancellor added. “I hope this is the beginning of other partnerships to benefit our students and the agricultural industry.” \n",

            "Congress woman candidate Lakshmibai Thuse was ridiculed based on her election symbol – the portable stone hand-mill Pune: In 1937, elections to the provincial legislatures were held under the Government of India Act 1935, a landmark piece of legislation that brought about significant democratic reforms in India, including direct polls. It provided suffrage rights to women based on literacy, property ownership or marriage to propertied men. It also granted forty-one reserved seats for women in the provincial legislatures, as well as limited reservations for them in the central legislature. There were two assembly seats from Pune city, with one reserved for women. The Congress party nominated Bhalchandra Maheshwar Gupte, a prominent lawyer, and Lakshmibai Thuse for these seats. The Lokshahi Swarajya Party had stood up to fight the Congress with Lakshmanrao Bhopatkar and Subhadrabai Tarkunde, both lawyers, as its candidates. The party comprised members from the so-called “Kesari” faction and those with allegiance to the Hindu Mahasabha. The contest was closely fought and both parties were criticised by many for their unsavoury behaviour during the poll campaign, with the Marathi newspaper “Dnyanaprakash” calling it a disgrace for the city. Keshavrao Jedhe, Narhar Vishnu Gadgil, and Gajanan Narayan Kanitakar, the Congress leaders, were called out for their speeches that were allegedly “casteist” and “anti-Brahmin”. Stones were pelted at campaign meetings held by Bhopatkar and Tarkunde. However, a greater controversy arose when Thuse was ridiculed based on her election symbol – the portable stone hand-mill. Grains like wheat, jowar, or bajra were ground for daily use in a portable hand-mill. Two circular stones were roughened on the corresponding surfaces, and laid one upon the other, a fixed pin in the lower stone passing loosely through the upper as an axis. The grain was put into the mill through an opening near the centre in the upper stone, which was turned by a handle fastened near its edge. The grain, when it had been broken or ground by the action and weight of the stone, was thrown out at the edges and caught in the receptacle in which the mill was placed. One of the first morning duties of the women in the North-west and Central India was to grind the corn required for the use of the family. The flour was made into flat loaves of bhakari or chapati. Born in Khopoli, Thuse was widowed at the age of eleven. Later, she went to Indore to study midwifery and worked as a nurse in Mumbai. But she, and her election symbol, were considered unworthy of representation in the legislative assembly by her opponents. For them, the hand-mill was worthless and mundane, just like the principle of non-violence that they abhorred. Bhopatkar and Tarkunde were contesting with the symbol of a roaring tiger. One of the leading Marathi newspapers in Pune, which espoused the Hindu nationalist cause, compared both the election symbols and advised Thuse to stay put in her kitchen. As a child widow, Thuse was not supposed to assert any power. She was to work in the kitchen and be submissive. Her profession was considered lowly. Her detractors also called her “ugly”. She did not fit their perception of an “ideal Indian woman”. Tarkunde, practising law since 1933, was then the only woman advocate of Pune. She had been appointed as the municipal pleader by the Poona City Municipality. She was married to Balkrishna M Tarkunde, who had studied at Oxford University and was also a lawyer. With his encouragement, she had cleared the advocate’s examination after their marriage. The “Dnyanaprakash”, usually mildly critical of the Hindu nationalists, extended its support to Tarkunde. “Pune needs someone better educated, someone who can argue in the legislative assembly as its representative; a midwife with a hand-mill as her symbol is hardly a worthy candidate”, it wrote on multiple occasions before the elections. It ignored Thuse’s socio-political contributions. Thuse had participated in the Home Rule Movement and contributed actively to the “Swarajya Fund”. She was a member of the Provincial Harijan Sevak Sangh and regularly visited the so-called “harijan bastis” to attend to ailing women and children. During the Civil Disobedience Movement of 1930, she was the “dictator” of the party in Pune for three months during which female satyagrahis picketed shops selling toddy and foreign goods, and endured lathi-charges. She organised volunteers to provide food and water to those protesting against the Raj. She took care of the wounded. More than a hundred women, including her, were imprisoned for six months during the Movement. She was a devoted follower of Mahatma Gandhi, who encouraged women to step out of their houses to participate in the independence struggle. Gandhi’s appeal to join the Congress garnered an amazing response. One moment, the women were confined to their homes, and the next, they were out on the streets picketing against toddy shops. Gandhi’s belief that the wife was the husband’s “comrade, his better half, colleague, and friend” drew criticism from conservative quarters. They were worried that women’s emancipation would erode their power base and shake the traditional patriarchal power they had over them. With the rise of the middle class in nineteenth-century Maharashtra, strong ideologies emerged on domesticity that borrowed Victorian ideals and revolved around the home, marriage, and motherhood. They created a clear division between the public and private spheres, with the home seen as a haven for peace, stability, virtue, and piety, which was to be held together by the woman by moral and emotional bonds. The Hindu nationalists supported limited emancipation of women in the twentieth century to aid the cause of a Hindu nation that was “strong” and “masculine”. Women were supposed to earn an education, participate in sports and physical education programmes, and practice religion so that they could give birth to “healthy, intelligent, and strong” children who would serve the society and the nation. Education for women was endorsed as a tool to enhance women’s social presence and make them more responsible towards their familial duties. Women were supposed to inculcate the virtues of cleanliness, companionship, discipline, and self-control through education and add to their traditional roles in the families, without challenging patriarchy. During the campaign, large posters of a hand-mill were put up in the city and at the Congress polling offices on the election day. People would shout - “We don’t want a hand-miller’s politics! Maharashtra is a tiger’s cub, and we need that spirit and attitude!” Congress workers would reply – “No one can work on an empty stomach. We have to buy grain and grind it to make flour, and for that, we need the hand-mill’. Thuse won the election by 3,702 votes. In 1937, eighty women were elected to legislative assemblies. India then had the third-highest number of female legislators in the world after the US and the Soviet Union. Thuse was elected to the State Legislative Assembly a couple of times more and contributed to the socio-political sector till her death. Tarkunde was elected as the president of the Pune Bar Association in 1966, perhaps the first Indian woman to grace the presidency of a bar association. She was also the first Indian woman to become president of the Debt Relief Fund. The burden of representing the inner or spiritual realm of the nation, however, is still delegated to the constructed image of the “modern Indian woman” who belongs to the so-called “upper caste” and upper class, is educated and religious, yet not “western”.

            "This discourse borders on a matter that sits at the intersection of education, ethics, and national development, that is, the regulation of honorary degrees in Nigeria’s tertiary institutions. The discourse is critical at this time as the abuse of the awards has become alarming, and while other African countries in the least are addressing the subject, the relevant organs in Nigeria appear to be indifferent for reasons best known to them. The situation is becoming so deplorable that it is best captured in the Yoruba proverb that “Ti a ba fun ni niyì, ki a ma fi owo Ewa je E niyì”, when honor is bestowed upon us, we must not devalue it by our own hands. This timeless saying captures the essence of our conversation today. Honorary degrees are one of the highest honors that universities can bestow. Yet, in our country today, this once hallowed tradition has become entangled in the murky waters of politics, patronage, and commercial interests. Alausa, Education Minister The need for reform could not be more urgent than now. If for nothing, let us emulate some other progressive countries in this regard. The tradition of honorary degrees, as inherited from ancient European universities, was designed to honor men and women whose works exemplified the finest ideals of humanity, those that are great thinkers, nation-builders, philanthropists, and those who, through service, had elevated society. Early Nigerian universities embraced this tradition with care and circumspection. At the University of Ibadan in its early decades, to be awarded an honorary degree was almost akin to canonization. Recipients were statesmen of unblemished character, towering academics, and icons of culture. The honorary degrees were symbolic and bereft of any academic rigour or scholarship. But fast-forward to today, and one observes a worrying trend. Honorary degrees have become tools of sycophancy, instruments of political signaling, and, in the worst cases, commodities for sale. Some universities, desperate for funds or relevance, have turned this noble recognition into a transactional affair. When individuals facing corruption trials or leaders with dubious records are garlanded with academic honors, the institution itself loses moral authority. The scenario is now turning out to be that from glory to controversy. Let us contextualize this with scenarios. Suppose the University of Lagos decides to honor an innovator who designed affordable solar technology for rural electrification. The award not only uplifts that individual but also signals to students and the nation that innovation is valued. Conversely, when a university confers an honorary degree on a controversial billionaire whose wealth source is opaque, the signal is that “anything goes.” Another scenario. Imagine Lagos State University choosing to honor a LASTMA officer who, over decades, distinguished himself in managing traffic with integrity and courage. Such a gesture would remind the public that true honor lies in service, not just in status. We cannot ignore the increasing politicization of honorary degrees. It has become common practice for universities to award serving governors, ministers, or legislators, often during their tenure, and frequently in anticipation of material favors in numerous ways such as in form of donations, endowments, or state allocations. This practice undermines the autonomy of the university and sends the wrong signal to students. How can a student believe in meritocracy when his university glorifies individuals whose legacies remain under question? Another albatross is that of the commercialization of the honors. In some quarters, the rumor, sometimes substantiated, is that honorary degrees are for sale. Business moguls, social celebrities, and even entertainers with questionable lifestyles suddenly parade themselves as “Doctor” this and “Doctor” that. Such commercialization is nothing short of an assault on academic integrity. Ordinarily, this ought to be a source of worry to the academic community but strangely, they seem to be totally indifferent and non-challant. The question is, are they not worried about the reputation of their institutions? When a university chooses to honor someone later convicted of fraud or corruption, the shame is not on the individual alone, it is obviously a stain on the entire institution. The university, as a custodian of truth and excellence, ought and must avoid such reputational risks. The attitude, however, as I opined above, is lackadaisical. The implication of this practice is the marginalization of the true heroes deserving of the honors. Countless Nigerians who deserve recognition, scientists working silently on life-saving research, community leaders transforming local lives, teachers shaping generations, and social reformers sacrificing personal comfort for public good, who truly merit the honors are overlooked. In most instances, the basis of denial is simply because they lack political power or deep pockets to connect them. This is not only injustice disguised as tradition but academic hara-kiri. The situation has degenerated so badly that the honors are not only largely valueless now but even threaten real and earned academic degrees as unveiled below. Except the system promptly responds to the challenge, there might be nothing to rescue again in due course. How does this system achieve this, I believe the basic route is the regulation of the process. Some may argue that regulation would infringe upon university autonomy. On the contrary, regulation would protect it. Autonomy without accountability is a recipe for abuse. By instituting a framework for honorary awards, Nigeria would not be curtailing freedom but safeguarding dignity. Regulation ensures consistency, fairness, and transparency. More importantly, it repositions honorary degrees as instruments of inspiration for our youth. This is imperative to curtail the ongoing abuse; and this approach is not going to be peculiar to Nigeria nor novel. Just recently in Ethiopia, the Ministry of Education issued directives barring serving government officials and political candidates from being nominated for honorary degrees. Full-time employees, members of the senate of the university or administrative staff of the institutions, unless their direct relationship with the institution has ended, are equally prohibited. The directive went further to restrict newly established universities from conferring the distinction, mandating them that to be able to make such awards, the institutions must have graduated at least eight cohorts of students and offer degrees such as PhDs, to qualify. Most significantly, in the determination of entitlements, the institutions are made to be under compulsion to ensure compliance with both national and international standards. My position is even simpler and much relaxed than this. It is that the minimum guidelines be set by the stakeholders and must be uniform while making compliance compulsory, with the attendant sanction in any case of violation. The failure to arrest the drift would ultimately amount to what Fela Anikulapo-Kuti once sang, “Teacher, don’t teach me nonsense.” If universities continue to elevate questionable characters, they indirectly teach students that character is dispensable so long as one has power or wealth. This essentially connotes the concept of teaching nonsense. Arising from the submission above, it will be expected that the National Universities Commission (NUC), working with the Committee of Pro- and Vice-Chancellors, produces a standardized framework. The framework must specify criteria for the conferment of the honor and it must, as of necessity, include:Demonstrable contributions to human knowledge, culture, or innovation; Evidence of service to humanity or significant community development; Proven ethical integrity and a clean record without any known pending corruption cases or convictions. This national benchmark would ensure uniformity across institutions. In the implementation of the framework, the Universities will establish independent vetting committees. This committee that every university would establish will constitute the honorary awards committee and must be insulated from political or financial influence. The committee must include respected academics, alumni, and perhaps even external referees of high moral standing. Their task would be to screen nominees carefully, assess their track records, and submit recommendations to the university senate. Ordinarily, I would have suggested the inclusion of the officials of the anti-corruption bodies but these days, there are challenges in that sector also. I therefore will only counsel the procurement of input from them. To guarantee transparency and public scrutiny, the universities will then publish their list of nominees ahead of convocation ceremonies, allowing room for objections or commendations from the public. Public accountability will ensure that controversial figures do not slip through the cracks. As unveiled above in Ethiopia, Serving politicians are barred from such awards. The framework must insist that honorary degrees should not be conferred on serving political office holders. A cooling-off period of at least five years after leaving office should apply. This ensures that society has had time to evaluate their legacies objectively. As proffered above, there must be sanctions accompanying the resolutions. Universities that flout the guidelines should face sanctions. The NUC could suspend their right to award honorary degrees for a specified number of years at the barest minimum while possibly criminalizing the abuse. This deterrent would discourage abuse. The import of applying the antidote will now be the unveiling of the unsung heroes. Institutions will then be encouraged to honor innovators, cultural icons, teachers, scientists, and social workers who represent true merit. By spotlighting these unsung heroes, universities would inspire the youth to believe that character and contribution matter more than wealth or power. This will also lead to the restoration of the integrity of the awarding institutions. In addition, the Regulation would restore dignity to tertiary institutions. A university’s worth is not only in its infrastructure but in its reputation. When a university confers honors only on individuals of proven merit, it builds credibility both nationally and globally. This will also be a source of inspiration to the students. Imagine the inspiration a student feels when her university confers an honorary degree on a Nobel Laureate, a community health worker who saved thousands during an epidemic, or a teacher who dedicated 40 years to molding minds. That is the power of symbolism. The adoption of such unified framework that is the product of the stakeholders will boost the autonomy of the institutions. No entity or individual can then dictate to the university. Ironically, this implies that, by establishing such clear national guidelines, the universities gain protection and is insulated against political pressure. A Vice-Chancellor can politely decline political lobbying by pointing to national policy. The further implication of this is the restoration of the battered national image. On the international stage, Nigerian universities would command greater respect. Currently, the credibility of our honorary degrees is questioned abroad because of the loose and inconsistent practices at home. The Regulation would reposition our institutions as serious custodians of knowledge and values. Globally, universities have withdrawn honorary degrees when recipients were later found wanting. Harvard University withdrew its honorary degree from Harvey Weinstein after his conviction. This shows that institutions must protect their reputations even retrospectively. Nigerian universities must be courageous enough to do the same. Again, Ghana Tertiary Education Commission recently deprecated the indiscriminate use honorary degrees. Ghana raised the alarm over the rise of so-called “degree mills”, dubious institutions awarding the honors for fees. The Commission has risen up to the challenge of the surge in the number of individuals falsely parading and identifying themselves as academic doctors or professors. This is basically targeted at the misuse of the titles. Just as Ethiopia did, Ghana also frowns at the increasing public use of honorary titles, particularly by politicians, religious leaders and business figures describing such as “deceitful and unethical”, warning that it erodes the value of genuine academic achievement. To this end, the countries have banned the use of honorific academic titles in the public, outside the awarding institution, in order to preserve the integrity of the academic degrees. In rounding up, let me acknowledge the recent petition of a Coalition of Academics and Professors for Qualified Use of Academic titles (CAPQAT) led by one Prof. Adeyemi Jonhson Ademowo to the various regulators decrying the increasing abuse of the academic titles. I salute the group. The fact remains that honorary degrees are not mere ornaments; they are symbols of the values we cherish as a society. In their current unregulated state in Nigeria, they risk becoming tools of ridicule rather than instruments of honor. As a Yoruba proverb teaches us: “Orúko rere sàn ju wúrà àti fàdákà”, a good name is better than gold or silver. Let us, therefore, insist that our universities bestow their highest honors only on those whose names enhance, rather than diminish the prestige of the academy. Regulation is not the enemy of autonomy; it is its safeguard. It is the compass that will guide our institutions back to dignity. By instituting national guidelines, independent vetting, public scrutiny, restrictions on serving politicians, and sanctions for abuse, we can restore trust in our tertiary institutions. Let the recipients of tomorrow’s honorary degrees be individuals whose lives teach our children that merit, service and integrity are the true measures of honor. Only then can we say, with clear conscience, that our universities remain citadels of learning, not marketplaces of favors. Let us not relegate the honorific degrees to the debased level that the award of National Honors is now assuming.

            "The Convener, Consumers Value Awards, Mr. Akonte Ekine, speaks about the impact of the initiative and the awareness it has created among brand consumers in the last three years and how consumers have been able to exercise their rights through voting in shaping brand perception across various products. Emma Okonji presents the excerpts: After three years of CVA, how would you assess the concept and consumer participation?The Consumers Value Awards has grown significantly over the last three editions. What started as a vision to give consumers a voice in rewarding value-driven brands has now become a national movement. Participation has risen steadily each year, both in terms of brands listed and consumers engaging in the voting process. We’ve seen consumers actively campaigning for their preferred brands, which show the level of ownership and belief in the process. For us, that validates the concept — consumers want to be heard, and CVA is a credible platform for that.How are companies reacting to the results of CVA so far?Companies are paying close attention. Many see the recognition not just as an award but as an endorsement by the consumer. For some brands, it has become a badge of honour that they proudly showcase in their marketing. Look at globacom when they won the award two years ago with the massive publicity on it, you can also see Checkers Custard, Waw detergent and Reload Multivitamin publicities on winning the award to mention those and even Leadway Insurance conversation on their first win of the award.Overall, the response has been positive and constructive, with brands appreciating that the results reflect genuine consumer perception.Are there specific examples of how companies are using the CVA result to adjust their product and service offerings?We are yet to have any of such information, however, we do have conversations with winners and nominated brands requesting for backend data and I think smart marketing teams will use that amongst other data available to them to interrogate the brands. We don’t want to claim what we have not experienced but truth be told, what CVA provide is a subtle strong valuation opportunity for brands as influencer of brand marketing and product development initiative.What informed the introduction of government agencies into the programme this year?Government agencies are major service providers, and in many cases, consumers interact with them more than private brands. We realized that empowering consumers to vote on their experiences with public service agencies creates accountability, transparency, and pressure to improve. It also provides the agencies themselves with valuable feedback they may not ordinarily receive in formal reports. Including them makes CVA a more holistic reflection of consumer experiences. Let also add that our goal is not political but pure better service experience for us all as consumers of government servicesHow would the companies so voted ensure the credibility of the voting by the public?The credibility of CVA lies in the transparency of our voting process. It is an open, digital system where consumers directly cast their votes without interference. We don’t collect money from companies to influence results, and we publish the entire process for accountability. For the companies, their responsibility is to continue to earn consumer trust so that votes reflect authentic satisfaction rather than short-term hype. Ultimately, credibility is maintained because it is the people themselves who decide. To cast your vote, you will get an OTP in your inbox or Spam. Just take the four digit PIN and put in the dialogue box. The email address is validated to vote across all the categories.Is CVA a feedback mechanism on perception and feelings by consumers of product offerings and satisfaction?Absolutely, CVA is more than an award — it is a consumer perception index. It captures how consumers feel about the value they are receiving in exchange for their money, time, and loyalty. The results highlight satisfaction levels, service gaps, and areas where brands are excelling. That’s why it is such a powerful feedback tool for companies, because it reflects the true voice of the marketplace.Is this a pro bono service to companies to understand where they are in the face of consumers?Yes, the voting and recognition process is entirely pro bono. Brands do not pay to be listed or to be voted for — the awards are earned strictly on merit through consumer votes. Our role is to provide the platform and ensure credibility. This makes CVA unique because it levels the playing field: whether you are a multinational, a local brand, or even a government agency, the only factor that counts is the consumer’s voice. That neutrality is what gives CVA its strength and integrity.What makes the Consumers Value Awards different from other industry awards?The difference is simple — CVA is powered entirely by consumers. Many industry awards are judged by panels or influenced by sponsorships, but CVA is strictly based on the votes of everyday consumers. This makes it the most democratic and transparent recognition platform in the country as at this moment. When a brand wins, it is because the people have spoken. That consumer-driven model is what sets us apart.How do you ensure that rural and less tech-savvy consumers are represented in the voting process?Inclusivity is central to our mission. We know that consumer experiences go beyond urban centers and smartphone users. That’s why we have invested in communication campaigns such as this and others. Our mobile-friendly voting portal is lightweight and works well even on basic devices. Over time, we’re exploring offline support systems to give more consumers, regardless of literacy or technology access, a chance to participate.What is the long-term vision for CVA?Our vision is to make CVA the benchmark for consumer trust and value in the country and eventually across Africa. We want companies and agencies to see it as an annual report card directly from the people they serve. Beyond the awards, we plan to release periodic consumer insights, deepen engagement, and create a knowledge base that shapes policy, innovation, and service delivery. Ultimately, the goal is for CVA to become the go-to reference for measuring consumer satisfaction in the country.The post Ekine: Brand Perception Will Improve Quality of Products appeared first on THISDAYLIVE. \n",

            "The Ministry of Culture will launch the ‘Gyan Bharatam’, a landmark national initiative dedicated to preserving, digitising, and disseminating India’s manuscript heritage. To mark this occasion, the Ministry of Culture is organising the first-ever Gyan Bharatam International Conference on ‘Reclaiming India’s Knowledge Legacy through Manuscript Heritage’ from 11th – 13th September at Vigyan Bhawan, New Delhi, according to the the Ministry of Culture. The conference will bring together over 1,100 participants, including scholars, experts, institutions, and cultural practitioners from across the country and abroad. It will create a collaborative platform for discussion, deliberation, and shaping the way forward in preserving, digitising, and sharing India’s manuscript heritage with the world. The ‘Gyan Bharatam’ will be launched as a visionary national movement dedicated to safeguarding and disseminating India’s vast manuscript wealth. It will serve both as a tribute to the nation’s civilisational roots and as a forward-looking step towards the Prime Minister’s vision of a Viksit Bharat by 2047, where India emerges as a true Vishwa Guru, combining the wisdom of its past with the innovation of its future. Designed as a comprehensive framework, ‘Gyan Bharatam’ will revive India’s manuscript legacy by combining preservation, digitisation, scholarship, and global accessibility. Its objectives include identification and documentation through a nationwide register, conservation and restoration of fragile texts, large-scale digitisation using AI-driven tools, and creation of a National Digital Repository. It will also focus on research, translation, and publication of rare manuscripts, capacity building for scholars and conservators, development of digital platforms, and public participation through collaborative programmes. Further, global partnerships and the integration of manuscript wisdom into education will strengthen India’s role in global knowledge exchange. Vivek Agarwal, Secretary Culture, in his briefing on the ‘Gyan Bharatam’ stated that the initiative, announced by the Prime Minister, is a major scheme for preserving India’s manuscript heritage. The Mission will undertake a nationwide survey and cataloguing of manuscripts, creation of a digital repository, and develop mechanisms to extract and disseminate the vast knowledge preserved in them, covering subjects ranging from science and medicine to literature, religion, and spirituality. He highlighted that ‘Gyan Bharatam’ will be implemented through a broad alliance of stakeholders, including libraries, religious institutions, and private custodians, ensuring manuscripts are preserved and made accessible for generations to come. Speaking on the ‘Gyan Bharatam’ International Conference, he noted that the three-day gathering will see the participation of more than 1,100 delegates, with deliberations across eight working groups on areas such as script decipherment, documentation, digitisation, conservation, and legal frameworks. Emphasising the role of technology, Agarwal informed that the Gyan-Setu AI innovation challenge has already received over 40 entries, with shortlisted innovations to be presented during the conference. He added that the PM will attend the conference on September 12, listen to the presentations of the working groups, and address the gathering thereafter. The valedictory session on September 13 will be chaired by the Home Minister Amit Shah \n",

            "With the unavoidable presence of AI tools rapidly transforming industries, the International Training Institute is taking the lead to educate and promote the use of Artificial Intelligence into Papua New Guinea’s workplaces, aiming to boost efficiency and productivity. A recent workshop held at ITI’s Badili Campus last Friday drew enthusiastic participation from various organizations, including Kina Bank, PNG Waterboard, Trends PNG Ltd, and others. The session, facilitated by ITI Lecturer and AI expert Mr. Syed Rizwan, offered attendees a comprehensive introduction to a suite of AI tools. Participants explored practical applications, from crafting personalized PowerPoint presentations using Canva and Gamma AI for concise summaries, to leveraging ChatGPT for data analysis and Google Colab for spreadsheet management. The workshop also touched upon creating models with GRADIO and utilizing Google AI Studio for diverse professional tasks. Joe Agavi, Executive Manager of Regional Operations at Water PNG Ltd, shared his enthusiastic feedback, calling the workshop an eye-opener. “You can’t live without the technology these days, and this actually will bring a lot of efficiency to operations,” Agavi stated. He highlighted the immediate benefits for his work, particularly in report generation and presentation. “This thing will actually summarize everything and put the reports there and then. It also brings efficiency.” Agavi admitted to prior limited knowledge of AI tools, expressing surprise at the breadth of applications covered. “I only know of one. Today I learned more than five or six. Today I got a snapshot of it and it’s really helpful.” Vetubu Kila, Acting Senior Portfolio Manager at Kina Bank, echoed Agavi’s views, emphasizing the transformative potential for daily tasks. “Often we rely on Excel and doing individual work. But through AI, I’ve learned a lot that there’s a way that we can just prompt AI, and then AI does everything for us, which makes our job to be really easy.” 14 participants in total attended this workshop as ITI promises to conduct more workshops in the months to come. ITI’s commitment to upskilling the PNG workforce in AI is composed to significantly impact various sectors, equipping professionals with the tools to navigate and excel in an increasingly technology-driven world. \n",

            "By Nitya ChakrabortyThe two day uprising in Nepal on September 8 and 9 resulting in the ouster of the KPS Oli government following the attacks and burning of the Parliament Building, Supreme Court and the official and private residences of the present and former powerful ministers, was an expression of total revolt by the generation Z in this Himalayan neighbour country of India against the established political system and its symbols in the country’s executive, legislature and judiciary.The uprising in Nepal by the young is different in many respects from the August 2024 developments in Bangladesh and 2022 students revolt in Sri Lanka. In Nepal, it took a mass character in just two days, the trigger being the killing of 19 demonstrators by the police on the first day itself. The death toll has by now reached 25. Further, the anger of the students were of a violent nature burning the offices of all established political parties including the three communist parties and the Nepali Congress. Significantly, in Nepal, both in Kathmandu and the two/three other cities, the school students took part in a big way, especially the girls, many of them belonging to the elite families.That way, the revolt in Nepal is the revolt of the Instagram, Facebook generation who are completely in a different mindset compared to the ruling elite including the communists. Both the communist parties of Nepal have a strong students organization but they were completely neutralized in the latest uprising as the generation Z revolted as a whole against the official ban on the 26 social media platforms. In fact this ban was the prime reason for the revolt as the generation Z in Nepal are totally enmeshed in their social media life and any interference by the elders in the family or the government, they are not in a mood to tolerate.The issue of corruption and unemployment came to the focus later when the killing of the movement participants gave a completely new dimension to the revolt by turning it into a movement against the government and the political system as a whole. That was why on the second day on September 9, many seniors joined and the generation Z movement took the character of a national movement. Out of the 2.96 crore population of Nepal, 1.17 crore are below 35 and the age group of 15-24 has 57.6 lakh. This group grew up with insta and facebook and they are the main drivers of the September uprising in Nepal.If we look at the turbulent politics and economy of Nepal in the last ten years, it will be seen that Nepal has not done too bad in terms of its economic development. Its growth rate has been at the level of 6 per cent in 2025. Though one in five young persons is unemployed, this unemployment issue did never emerge as a big one. Nepalese youth always look for jobs outside. On an average 4 lakh Nepalese leave for jobs outside every year. Similarly, Nepal gets huge remittances from outside and that along with earnings from tourism help the economic growth of the country.According to World Bank data, Nepal’s fiscal indicators are thriving. It remains the country that pays the highest duties on vehicles, similar to Singapore, and has the highest tax-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratio in South Asia. Social indicators have dramatically improved, with life expectancy moving from 54.77 years in 1990 to nearly 72 years in 2024. Primary school enrolment is close to a hundred per cent, and the literacy rate has increased from 59 per cent in 2000 to 76 per cent in 2024. Poverty has reduced from 25.16 per cent in 2011 to 20.27 per cent in 2023 as per the Nepal Living Standard Survey 2022/23. Remarkably, 81 per cent of Nepalis live in their own homes, and four out of five Nepali families have at least someone working or living abroad. The population has increased by 10 million between 1991 and 2021 – a 50-per cent increase in over three decades.But the political management of the country has come under sharp criticism in the last ten years of rule by the established political parties in Nepal. In this period, the ruling power was limited to three/four political leaders and their families and friends prospered giving the impression of all round corruption. Among the school students, the nepokids discussion became common. The September movement by the school students was also a sort of expression of their wrath against the nepo kids meaning the children of the ruling families.Three familiar political leaders – K P Sharma Oli, Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ and Sher Bahadur Deuba – have been playing the game of musical chairs. Oli of the Communist Party (CPN) of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) has been able to stay at the helm, splitting and uniting the communist parties. He has become prime minister for the third time at the age of 72 years. He has managed to sideline his two key opponents within his party by pushing them to split and forming a new party. He continues to expel people who confront him.Dahal ‘Prachanda’ rose to prominence leading a violent insurgency. He became prime minister for the first time in 2008, winning the highest number of seats for the CPN (Maoist Centre) in the constituent assembly. He became prime minister twice after that. The 70-year-old Dahal has been part of different coalitions and is accused of proliferating his family’s involvement in a dynastic manner. He is a big manipulator and manages to stay at the top.Deuba, the oldest of the trio, is 79 years. He has become the prime minister five times. A shrewd politician, he knows how to look after his family’s interests. He split with the Nepali Congress to start his faction and then reunited to lead the party since 2016. He pushed his opponent, Ram Chandra Paudel, to become the President and kept the Koirala clan at bay by playing different family factions against one another. He has no political scruples. He can align with anyone to get the highest position.The turmoil in Nepal is still on. The Nepalese army chief and also the President of the country are trying to ease tensions and hold negotiations with the student agitators. The demonstrators have no ready programme. They are only talking of fight against corruption and the political parties. Next few days will show how the next course of politics moves in Nepal. Much will depend on the negotiating capability of the army chief and the President. The leading politicians have lost the trust of the students as also the people.

            "Fort Worth mother Kim Medford always asks her kids for their birthday wishes. Her youngest, Noah, was no exception earlier this year. After blowing out his candles, Noah answered his mom’s annual question: “I just wish I could read. I just wish I could read.” Medford recounted her son’s difficulties during a Fort Worth City Council meeting Tuesday. She was joined by several other parents and advocates who praised a summer dyslexia screening program called Literacy Roundup . About half of students living in Fort Worth cannot read proficiently , according to a Fort Worth Education Partnership analysis. The program, a partnership between the city and the Sid W. Richardson Foundation, determined Noah was dyslexic and empowered Medford to ask the right questions at his school so he can receive the help he deserves, his mother said. Noah was one of about 400 children who the Literacy Roundup helped, said Caroline James, who led the effort. Besides screenings, the program connected families with volunteers to guide them to receive services from their schools. ENJOY READING THE NEWS AGAIN Discover refreshing, nonpartisan reporting on stories happening in your backyard. Literacy Roundup was set up at six community centers and libraries during the summer.

Sent to your inbox every Tuesday. “Don’t forget to serve the families on the east side,” she said. “Don’t forget about those kids who are most vulnerable.” Medford long suspected Noah, a sixth grader at William Monnig Middle School, was dyslexic. Two of Noah’s brothers were previously diagnosed with the learning disorder. Noah started school in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. At home, the problems were apparent to his mom. She asked the teachers at his private school what was happening and they pinned it on the pandemic, the fact he was just slow, that he’s a boy and asserted he’d pick up soon, she said. But he didn’t. Noah had to repeat the second grade, Medford said. At the end, the private school told her it did not have the resources to properly support Noah. During Noah’s first week of third grade at Como Elementary, Medford met with his teachers and went over her concerns. He can’t sound out words. He’s twisting letters. His brothers are dyslexic. Medford ran into similar excuses, she said. He was moved along in third, fourth and fifth grades. James, the Literacy Roundup leader, screened Noah at Como Community Center. She estimated he was reading on a second-grade level. “The problem is he knows it,” James said. His mom sees the impact every day. “Noah’s very prideful,” Medford said. “He understands that he’s behind all of his classmates.” Medford was grateful that Literacy Roundup gave her family a tangible action plan to help Noah. Thousands of students have yet to receive similar help, advocates said. Medford still faces the same barriers and comments she’s encountered every year, she said. She’s hopeful Noah’s wish will come true soon. Disclosure: The Sid W. Richardson Foundation has been a financial supporter of the Fort Worth Report.

            "T hese days, Carver Gayton, ’60, ’72, ’76, thinks a lot about his maternal great-grandfather, Lewis Garrard Clarke. When Gayton was a child, his mother read to him and his siblings from Harriet Beecher Stowe’s account, “The Key to Uncle Tom’s Cabin. ” The author pointed out that Clarke, who had escaped enslavement in Kentucky, was the prototype for her character George Harris in her novel “Uncle Tom’s Cabin.” Gayton first thought that Clarke’s history was simply a story shared within his family. But as he grew older, he learned much more from a distant cousin, historians and his own research. Clarke had been a conductor on the Underground Railroad and later a national figure who traveled the North speaking out against slavery. Clarke’s memoir was the first work by a former slave to be acquired by the Library of Congress and copyrighted. “It’s kind of otherworldly,” Gayton says, adding that throughout his life, his great-grandfather has been both a presence and an inspiration. In exploring more of Clarke’s life, Gayton realized he needed to share his own story for future generations. “ Carver Clark Gayton: Odyssey of a Seattle Native Son ” was published this spring by University of Washington Press. Born in Seattle into a large, heritage-rich family, Gayton has a lineage that runs deep in the Pacific Northwest. His paternal grandfather, for example, was a civic pioneer who arrived in the city in 1889, became a respected local leader who founded several Black community organizations and served as the region’s U.S. District Court librarian. Gayton followed in those successful footsteps. He thrived at Garfield High School, earning All-State honors in football and serving as class president. He attended the University of Washington on a football scholarship and played in the 1960 Rose Bowl. But his journey through the UW would be about much more than football. Gayton later taught high school and coached in Seattle before becoming the first Black FBI agent from Washington state. “I could have gotten a degree from what I learned in the FBI,” he says. After several years of federal employment around the country, Gayton returned to the UW in 1968 as its first Black full-time assistant football coach. Amid campus and team racial tensions, he recruited players and helped diversify the program. But in 1970, he resigned from the Athletics Department in protest over the suspension of several Black players. He stayed on campus, though, working as the first UW director of affirmative action programs. During this time, he also earned a Ph.D. in public administration. Gayton began a tenure-track career at Florida State University but was soon lured back to Seattle by a position at Boeing, where he worked for 18 years in roles including corporate director of college and university relations. From 1997 to 2001, he served as the Washington state commissioner of employment security. Throughout his career, Gayton remained connected to the UW as a lecturer at the Evans School of Public Policy & Governance and through numerous volunteer roles. In 2005, Gayton embarked on a new chapter, one that brought together his love of history and his commitment to community. He became the founding executive director of the Northwest African American Museum. Partnering with Barbara Earl Thomas, ’73, ’77, as deputy director, and Brian Carter, ’08, as education director, he helped shape the institution from the ground up. For Gayton, this wasn’t just a career move, it was a natural evolution of a lifelong pursuit, rooted in honoring the past and inspiring future generations. Gayton’s own story goes beyond career achievements or family legacy. It’s a testament to community, learning and perseverance. From believing the schoolteacher who once told him he was smarter than he realized to watching his daughter, Cynthia, become a national figure in technology and law, to navigating personal loss, Gayton describes his path as a journey built on embracing opportunities. “Expect nothing,” he says. “Appreciate everything.” Carver Gayton’s new book is available for purchase from UW Press. \n",

            "A Brooklyn family wants answers after years of dealing with unreliable school bus service. They say it takes four to five hours per day for their developmentally disabled child to get to and from school. On the day CBS News New York spoke to him, Antonio Fazio didn't look like it but was relieved to finally be home. The trip from the Sterling School in Cobble Hill to his house in Bergen Beach took a little over two hours. The fourth grader, who has ADHD, anxiety, and dyslexia, is enrolled in an individualized education program at the Sterling School, which was created for students with language-based disabilities. However, his parents say he sometimes misses the one-on-one literacy instruction first thing in the morning because he's getting to school late. \"The whole reason we send him to this school is so he can get this instruction,\" Maria Fazio said. \"It's tough. It's tough on him. It's tough on us,\" father Frank Fazio said. The boy's parents say the school bus tasked with transporting him to and from school has about a dozen pickups along its route. Maria Fazio said sitting on the bus for more than 90 minutes is illegal. \"In my case, hopefully they follow his IEP, which says he shouldn't be on the bus with more than five children, to alleviate the length of time that he's traveling,\" Maria Fazio said. Antonio's parents say they constantly have to adjust their schedules around their son's pickup and drop off. Maria Fazio is a teacher, so her schedule is a bit more rigid. Frank Fazio is a firefighter who works the opposite shift and has to constantly say no to overtime. A representative from the Department of Education says it has a network of 9,000 routes that transport 150,000 students throughout the city, and, \"While almost all of our students receive quality, on-time service every single day, we take every individual report seriously and are actively looking into this incident so that we can address it appropriately.\" The DOE suggests families refer complaints to its call center, but the Fazio family says they have been sending emails and filing complaints with the City Council education chair, and DOE Office of Pupil Transportation for the two years Antonio has been at his new school -- to no avail. \"We've called OPT. We've filed complaints. We have multiple incident reports. We have multiple threads with staff members at OPT and DOB. Nothing gets done,\" Maria Fazio said. CBS News New York also reached out to the City Council education chair, but did not immediately hear back. The bus company, Y&M Transit, declined to comment.

            "From Camden and Cherry Hill to Trenton and the Jersey Shore, what about life in New Jersey do you want WHYY News to cover? Let us know. A few Camden residents appeared before the New Jersey State Board of Education to list their concerns about the Camden City School District, which has been under state control since 2013. During the Tuesday afternoon public comment period, residents said they are concerned about the lack of significant academic improvement in the district, the effects of deep cuts to address a $91 million deficit and the lack of transparency in the hiring process for the next superintendent of the state-run district. “Over a decade ago, the state of New Jersey took control of the Camden City School District promising to fix our failing schools and provide better outcomes for our children,” said Alesha Figueroa-Falcon, executive director of Parents Invincible, a nonprofit that advocates for school choice. “We are on the verge of a reality where Camden no longer has city public district schools. That’s unacceptable.” Faheem Lea, canvassing director and community liaison for Camden Parents Union, a community group, said he agrees with Figueroa-Falcon. “In the last 13 years or so, we’ve seen a sharp decline in schools and literacy rates, traditional public schools being closed and we’re seeing a lot of people leaving the district,” he said. Camden parents tell search firm what they want in the next leader of its state-run school district A national search firm has been collecting feedback from parents on characteristics they want in the next superintendent of the Camden City School District. 3 months ago The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that the district’s graduation rate showed modest gains , while the dropout rate has declined since 2013. But, student performance still lags behind the rest of the state. The district is also grappling with chronic absenteeism that is higher than before the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Lea said there is an opportunity to hire a superintendent who can improve the district, but the community needs to be part of the process. “We need to know who they are,” he said. “The community needs to be involved and who is coming to our city to regulate the Camden City School District.” Kevin Waters, who retired from the Camden City School District before the recent cuts were implemented, said the support staff who lost their jobs due to the budget crunch served critical roles in schools. “As a therapist and a counselor myself, those individuals who were let go, were a part of a function to help in the way of providing students supports,” he said. “Those individuals on some level need to be able to come back.” Wednesday’s public testimony session was one of three scheduled by the state board for the school year where people can come to speak about any topic they wish to address. The other sessions are scheduled for January and May, according to the state’s website . Camden students and parents are rallying against deep school cuts: ‘They don’t care about us’ The cuts, which include hundreds of jobs, will affect essential staff and programs, district families say. 4 months ago At least 20 people registered in advance to speak before the board. They were split up into two groups. The majority of concerns from Camden residents were heard by board Vice President Nedd James Johnson and Board Member Jack Fornaro. At the beginning of the meeting, Johnson said that testimony would be shared with other board members. Last June , students from the Camden district tried to address the state board, but board members were not taking public comments. That prompted the students to hold a rally outside of the Department of Education building to express their concerns and opposition to the district’s budget cuts. Get daily updates from WHYY News!

            "Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has kicked off the development of a new strategic framework for the country’s payments ecosystem with the launch of the Nigeria Payments System Vision 2028 (PSV 2028), setting the stage for a more inclusive, innovative, and globally competitive digital financial system. Olayemi Cardoso, CBN Gov At the recent inaugural meeting of the PSV 2028 Project Committee held in Lagos, Musa Jimoh, director of the Payments System Policy Department (PSPD), described the initiative as a “national assignment” with the potential to transform how individuals, businesses, and governments interact within the financial ecosystem. Reflecting on the journey from the early reforms of 2006 through the milestones of PSV 2020 and PSV 2025, Jimoh highlighted that the new vision will build on past achievements to deepen financial inclusion. This, he noted, will improve infrastructure interoperability and promote innovation across Nigeria’s financial services sector. He observed that while Nigeria’s payment system has made significant progress over the past two decades, the speed of technological advancement and innovation continues to grow. PSV 2028, he explained, presents the country with a unique chance to develop a future-ready framework that is secure, efficient, and globally competitive. He further explained that the framework would be developed through an inclusive, stakeholder-led process that unites regulators, banks, fintechs, payment service providers, consumer advocacy groups, and other key players. He highlighted that this collaborative approach will ensure the strategy reflects real-world needs, fosters policy acceptance, and promotes innovation through shared responsibility. To facilitate its implementation, five thematic working groups were established, concentrating on: Infrastructure & Interoperability; Digital Financial Inclusion, Consumer Protection & Financial Literacy; Innovation, Digital Identity & Emerging Technologies; Cross-Border Payments & CBDC Integration; and Regulation, Risk Management & Cybersecurity. A sixth group on Strategic Communications and Stakeholder Engagement was also proposed. Participants at the event welcomed the initiative, praising the CBN’s inclusive approach and highlighting the pivotal role of PSV 2028 in promoting digital innovation, financial inclusion, and economic resilience. By sharing expertise and resources, they committed to creating a forward-looking document that would strengthen Nigeria’s position in Africa’s payments landscape while making progress globally. Also, speaking at the event, Mr. Ajao Niyi, former chief executive of the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS), praised the CBN for establishing a new standard for stakeholder engagement and urged all parties to unite in support of the initiative. The PSV 2028, which succeeds the soon-to-expire PSV 2025, is expected to serve as the guiding blueprint for Nigeria’s digital payments ecosystem over the next three years, aligning the country’s financial system with global best practices and ensuring sustainable growth. It marks a bold step forward in Nigeria’s digital financial transformation, setting the stage for a more connected, innovative, and inclusive economy \n",

            "More than half (54%) of pensioners on low incomes find it a struggle to keep up with bills and credit commitments, according to research for the Living Wage Foundation . Three in 10 (30%) said they are in some level of debt and just over a third (35%) said they rely on money from other sources such as benefits or money from friends, family, a partner to get by. A fifth (20%) said they could not afford an unexpected but necessary expense of £200, making them potentially vulnerable if, for example, their washing machine or boiler broke down and needed replacing or repairing. Nearly half (48%) have cut back on hobbies and entertainment and 43% have reduced spending on gifts or donations, while 24% said they can rarely, if ever, afford the non-essentials that make life enjoyable. Two-fifths (42%) of pensioners on a low income had considered themselves to be middle- to high-earners for the bulk of their working lives before retirement. Meanwhile, 21% said they use their savings to cover everyday expenses, according to the survey, carried out by Savanta, among more than 500 people aged 66-plus across the UK in June. For the research, people were defined as being on a low income if they were below the threshold for a “living pension”. Different thresholds were used to account for people’s different living circumstances. For example, the monthly income threshold for a single homeowner was £1,162 but for a couple renting privately it was £2,489. More than a quarter (26%) of those surveyed said their income makes them more anxious and 25% said it has worsened their sleep. The research also indicated that pensioners who rent or live alone were more likely to be in debt. Some 43% of renters were in some level of debt compared with 23% of homeowners. And 40% of people living alone were in debt compared with 25% of people living with a partner. Around a third (34%) of people living alone said they could not afford an unexpected but necessary expense of £200 compared to 14% of people living with a partner. Meanwhile 31% of renters and 15% of homeowners said they would not be able to meet a £200 unexpected cost. The research also found that many of those on low incomes were reliant on the state pension as their main source of income, with 54% having no workplace pension to draw on. The Living Wage Foundation’s living pension accreditation is a voluntary savings target for employers looking to help workers build up a pension pot to meet at least their basic needs in retirement. Living pension employers commit to providing a living pension savings level, using either a cash or percentage target. More than 75 employers are accredited, including Everton Football Club, Aviva and L&G. The report quoted Sheila, a pensioner in her 80s, who said: “It’s tough, really tough. “Everyone thinks older people are all rich, but it’s just not true. “I’ve not turned my heating on for three years. “I go running every day to keep warm in the winter and try to grow as many vegetables as I can in the summer. “Our pension barely covers the basics, so there is no room for anything extra.” She added: “When something breaks, the boiler, fridge, or I need a new pair of shoes, I panic, because I know I can’t just replace it. “The constant stress and worry chips away at you. “Living on my own also makes it harder. “There’s no one to share bills with, no family to lean on.” “I would say, we pensioners are not asking for luxuries, we just want enough to get by. “We worked, we paid in, and now we’re left to struggle.” Katherine Chapman, director of the Living Wage Foundation, said: “These findings show the tough reality for too many pensioners who, after a lifetime of work, are still left without enough to live on. “No one should be worrying about putting the heating on when it’s cold or boiling the kettle for a cup of tea.” Samantha Brown, a managing partner at living pension employer Herbert Smith Freehills Kramer, said: “Tackling the retirement savings gap will require a multi-pronged approach: expanding access to workplace savings schemes, improving financial literacy, and encouraging consistent long-term contributions. “The key to this lies in exploring innovative strategies and advocating for policy reforms that help build more resilient retirement outcomes for future generations.” A Government spokesperson said: “Supporting pensioners is a top priority and, thanks to our commitment to the triple lock, millions will see their yearly state pension rise by £1,900 this Parliament. “We have also run the biggest-ever campaign to boost pension credit take-up, with over 57,000 extra pensioner households being awarded the benefit, worth on average around £4,300 a year. “To ensure tomorrow’s pensioners will not be poorer than today’s, we are reviving the Pension Commission to tackle the barriers that stop too many people from saving.” \n",

            "A recent announcement by the provincial government may be a benefit to schools across the Prince Albert area. Applications for the new School Playground Equipment Grant program are now open. Saskatchewan Rivers Public School Division Director of Education Neil Finch told paNOW they are in the process of reaching out to schools. “We are in the initial stages with this, and schools will decide if they apply for this grant or not,” he said. Eligible projects can receive up to $50,000 in matching funds to build a new playground. Funds can also be used to add new equipment or replace components on an existing playground. “The province is investing $3.75 million annually over the next four years to enrich outdoor play spaces throughout Saskatchewan,” Parks, Culture and Sport Minister Alana Ross said. “This program supports the incredible work done by volunteer school community councils and parent groups who raise money to create safe, accessible playgrounds for their children. It benefits the kids, families, and their communities, and I look forward to seeing more projects break ground.” The application period will run from Sept. 9 to Feb. 25, on a first-come, first-served basis. The program will be administered in partnership with the Saskatchewan Parks and Recreation Association (SPRA). “Playgrounds are critical spaces that contribute to a healthy Saskatchewan population,” Saskatchewan Parks and Recreation Association President Darcy McLeod said. “Investments like the School Playground Equipment Grant help instill the importance of play and physical literacy in our children and youth, which in turn will build a more active future for our province.” The program is open to school community councils and parent groups affiliated with publicly funded schools, school divisions, and First Nation schools in Saskatchewan. Publicly funded schools include: public, separate, Francophone, Independent (including alternative independent schools, associate schools, historical high schools, qualified independent schools, and certified independent schools) and First Nations schools. Overview of the eligibility criteria: Full guidelines along with the online grant application are available on the SPRA website . paNOW also attempted to contact the Prince Albert Catholic School Division for comment but they did not respond in time for the publication deadline. — nigel.maxwell@pattisonmedia.com On X: @nigelmaxwell \n",

            "CLINTON - Erika Stewart, principal of Clinton Community Junior/Senior High School has been named Rural Principal of the Year by the Wisconsin Rural Schools Alliance (WiRSA). Jeff Eide, executive director of the Wisconsin Rural Schools Alliance, said schools around the state nominate their local principals for the Principal of the Year honor. Nominations are then reviewed by the WIRSA 20-member board and a recommendation for the winner is made. Clinton School District Administrator Jim Brewer nominated Stewart for the award. She was principal at Clinton Middle School for three years and she now is entering her fifth year as principal of the Clinton Junior/Senior High School. Before becoming a principal, Stewart was a seventh grade science teacher in the Clinton district. Stewart is recognized for her outstanding leadership, innovative practices, and dedication to rural education. She has led with vision and compassion, guiding students and staff to higher levels of achievement while fostering an inclusive and supportive school culture. Stewart played a key role during the district’s reorganization from three buildings to two. “Erika brings out the best in her staff and students, combining strength, kindness, fairness, and compassion,” said Dr. Jim Brewer, District Administrator of the Clinton Community School District. “Her leadership has not only advanced Clinton Junior/Senior High School but has made a tremendous impact on our entire community.” Stewart’s work extends beyond the classroom, as she consistently engages families, educators, and community members in the decision-making process. Known for empowering teachers and celebrating the potential of every student, she embodies the very best of rural education leadership. “Erika Stewart is an outstanding principal who has consistently provided me with the space, support, and opportunities to grow both inside and outside the classroom,\" said Clinton teacher Ryan Brandon. \"Her willingness to listen and offer her wisdom has been invaluable. She is a true asset to Clinton Junior/Senior High School, and I am incredibly grateful for her guidance.” “It is not easy being the leader of a middle school and it is not easy being the leader of a high school; however, the job is twice as difficult when you are the leader of a 7–12 building,\" said Clinton teacher Dave Fridley. \"Erika has successfully led us in the creation of Clinton Junior/Senior High School. We combined two staffs with different philosophies into one staff with a shared philosophy. She has continued to push for enhancing literacy instruction.\" Get any of our free email newsletters — news headlines, obituaries, sports, and more. \n",

            "AIMING to break the cycle of generational poverty, Perak is focusing its eradication efforts at sub-district (mukim) level to provide more direct and effective aid to vulnerable communities. State women, family, social welfare, cooperatives and entrepreneur development committee chairman Datuk Salbiah Mohamed said the new strategy allowed for more targeted interventions, especially for high-risk groups such as second-generation families in poverty and school dropouts. “This is to ensure that poverty is not inherited and families can move up to a better social level,” she said during the state assembly sitting at Bangunan Perak Darul Ridzuan in Jalan Panglima Bukit Gantang Wahab, Ipoh. “We want to break the cycle of poverty through education, skills training and social mobility.” To achieve this, she said the initiative employed a two-pronged approach. “For education, the state is rolling out school entry aid, one-off assistance for enrolment in higher education, scholarships and study loans. “To boost household income, support is provided through business equipment aid, entrepreneurship grants and job-matching programmes.” Salbiah was responding to a question from Yusri Bakir (BN-Ayer Kuning) regarding the state’s latest poverty eradication reforms. Underpinning this localised effort is the Poverty Task Force, established in 2024. Salbiah explained that the task force met monthly at district and state levels to keep data on poor households current, enabling various agencies to coordinate their efforts effectively. “This is part of our long-term commitment under Perak Sejahtera 2030, and the results are clear,” she added. \n",

            "DALLAS — At The King's Academy in Dallas, educators are preparing for what could be a transformative opportunity for their students and families. The private school, which serves low-income students and operates on a pay-what-you-can model, is positioning itself to take advantage of Texas' new Education Savings Account program, also known as the school choice program. \"Salvation is free, but everything else costs,\" said Shailendra Thomas, head of school at The King's Academy, highlighting the financial challenges faced by families seeking private education alternatives. The school relies on fundraising to serve its student population, and Thomas said money is always tight. But the new state program could provide relief. Acting Texas State Comptroller Kelly Hancock, who oversees the billion-dollar program, recently met with students and teachers at the academy to explain how the system will work, and get feedback on new rules , so the office is ready to launch in January. \"There's a billion dollars in the program and frankly, I'd love to sell out,\" Hancock said, emphasizing the state's commitment to the initiative. Under the program, qualifying students can receive approximately $10,000 annually, with additional funding available for students with specialized needs. The program uses public dollars to support private education, homeschooling, or other state-approved programs. Hancock said the state will prioritize low-income students and students with special needs. \"This provides another opportunity for those who are looking for other options,\" Hancock explained. Breaking down those allotments, it's possible the fund could serve around 100,000 students out of Texas' more than 5 million students. While the $10,000 allocation will help offset tuition costs, Hancock acknowledged it may not cover all expenses at private institutions. \"A lot of the private schools will have scholarships that can go along with it,\" he said. \"What it does is open the opportunity for a lot more individuals.\" Thomas expressed enthusiasm for the program's potential impact on her school community, where families are required to contribute what they can afford. \"Every family has to have skin in the game,\" Thomas said, explaining the school's current financial model. \"Our hope is, and our goal is that everyone who wants to participate will get to participate,\" Hancock said of the statewide program. When applications open next year, Thomas said, The King's Academy plans to be ready. You can get updates on program status by signing up for alerts , according to the Texas Comptroller website. \"We should be first in line,\" she said. The Education Savings Account program represents a significant shift in Texas education policy, directing public funds toward private school options for qualifying families seeking alternatives to traditional public education. \n",

            "Children who receive their first smartphone before the age of 13 are significantly more likely to face long-term mental health struggles, according to new global research. ALSO READ: Holidays: Five ways to guide children on healthy screen habits The study, which analyzed data from more than 100,000 young people worldwide, links early smartphone ownership to suicidal thoughts, aggression, and detachment from reality, hallucinations, poor self-worth, and weakened emotional regulation. Published in the Journal of Human Development and Capabilities, the research is based on Sapien Labs’ Global Mind Project, the world’s largest database on mental wellbeing. ALSO READ: Mental health: Understanding risks of social media addiction, finding balance Findings show that 18- to 24-year-olds who had smartphones at age 12 or younger were far more likely to report severe psychological symptoms. Using the Mind Health Quotient (MHQ) tool, researchers found scores fell suddenly the earlier a child acquired a device, from an average of 30 at age 13 to 1 for those given one at age five. The study identifies early social media access as the single biggest driver of poor outcomes, explaining about 40% of the link, followed by disrupted family relationships (13%), disturbed sleep (12%), and cyberbullying (10%). Girls who received smartphones earlier were more likely to struggle with self-worth, body image, and emotional stability, while boys reported less confidence, lower empathy, and poorer self-image. Lead author Dr. Tara Thiagarajan, founder and Chief Scientist of Sapien Labs, said the findings suggest symptoms go beyond depression and anxiety, extending to aggression, suicidal thoughts, and detachment that traditional screeners (standard tests) often miss. With the average age of first ownership now below 13 globally, she called for urgent policy action similar to regulations on alcohol and tobacco. The researchers recommend four measures; mandatory digital literacy and mental health education, strict enforcement of social media age rules with accountability for tech companies, restrictions on children’s access to platforms, and progressive limits on smartphone use. Several countries including France, the Netherlands, Italy, and New Zealand have restricted phones in schools, with New York recently joining a number of U.S. states adopting bans to improve student focus. In an interview with The New Times, Dr. Darius Gishoma, the Division Manager for Mental Health at the Rwanda Biomedical Centre (RBC), said Rwanda has yet to generate comprehensive national data linking smartphone use to mental health concerns among children and adolescents, though evidence from other parts of the world shows serious risks. “For Rwanda, we don’t have specific data on this, but clinical experience shows screen overuse often appears as an associated problem when young people present with issues such as alcohol addiction, depression, or gambling,” he explained. He added that most research identifies several categories of children, those below five, those between five and 12, and adolescents, who face high risks from screen exposure. Among the most commonly reported effects is disruption of natural sleep cycles. “Children spending long hours on screens sleep less, and poor sleep impacts cognitive function,” he said. Dr. Gishoma added that excessive screen use interferes with social interaction as children who spend too much time on screens tend to interact less with their peers or parents. He added that high usage leads to hyperarousal (heightened alertness), concentration difficulties, negative emotions, and conduct problems, noting that there are so many studies showing the negative impact on social interaction, cognitive function, emotional stability, and behavioral issues. While clinical consultations rarely refer to screen addiction as the leading cause, he noted it frequently emerges during assessments. “It is not often the main complaint, but we discover it is associated once we dig deeper into the person’s problems,” he said. He cautioned that excessive screen use is linked to sedentary lifestyles such as prolonged sitting, binge-watching videos, and spending hours on social media, which may increase the risk of obesity and other physical health problems. When asked about strategies to address smartphone-related mental health risks in Rwanda, Gishoma said the country is focusing on three main approaches: public awareness campaigns, school-based interventions, and treatment for severe cases, noting that general awareness of these risks already exists, partly due to media discussions. “We also have the school-based mental health program, introduced four years ago, which addresses risky behaviours in schools, including excessive screen use. And when there is real screen addiction, treatment services are available.” On age-appropriate smartphone use, the mental health expert mentioned the role of parents, noting that experts recommend no screen time for children under two or three years, and no more than one hour per day for older children. While these guidelines can be adapted to Rwanda, the primary responsibility for managing usage according to age lies with parents, he added. Dr. Gishoma said young people are more vulnerable to cyberbullying and unhealthy comparisons on social media. He explained that harsh feedback about appearance or lifestyle can harm their emotional wellbeing, and that social media often blurs the line between private and public life. “The school-based mental health program, which began in 2020, is already operational in 17 of 30 districts, including Karongi, Bugesera, and Gicumbi. In these schools, we try to have both a male and female counselor, who help with awareness, screening, and linking children with challenges to care. The program is being scaled up progressively to reach all districts,” he said. \n",

            "By COLLIN BINKLEY, AP Education WriterWASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is ending several grant programs reserved for colleges that have large numbers of minority students, saying they amount to illegal discrimination by tying federal money to racial quotas.In a shift upending decades of precedent, the Education Department said Wednesday it now believes it’s unconstitutional to award federal grants using eligibility requirements based on racial or ethnic enrollment levels. The agency said it’s holding back a total of $350 million in grants budgeted for this year and called on Congress to “reenvision” the programs for future years.More than $250 million of that figure was budgeted for the government’s Hispanic-Serving Institution program, which offers grants to colleges and universities where at least a quarter of undergraduates are Hispanic. Congress created the program in 1998 after finding that Latino students were going to college and graduating at far lower rates than white students.Several smaller programs are also being cut, including $22 million for schools where at least 40% of students are Black, along with programs reserved for schools with certain enrollment levels of Asian American, Pacific Islander or Native American students. The programs have traditionally received bipartisan support in Congress and were created to address longstanding racial disparities in education.Not included in the cuts is federal funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities, which are open to all students regardless of race.“Diversity is not merely the presence of a skin color,” Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement Wednesday. “Stereotyping an individual based on immutable characteristics diminishes the full picture of that person’s life and contributions, including their character, resiliency, and merit.”McMahon added that she aims to work with Congress to repurpose the funding for institutions that serve “underprepared or under-resourced” students without using quotas. She did not elaborate on plans to repurpose the $350 million.The government’s grants for Hispanic-Serving Institutions are being challenged in a federal lawsuit brought by the state of Tennessee and the anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions. Tennessee argues that all of its public universities serve Hispanic students, but none meet the “arbitrary ethnic threshold” to be eligible for the grants.The Justice Department declined to defend the grants in the lawsuit, saying in a July memo that the 25% enrollment requirement violates the Constitution.In court filings, a national association of Hispanic-Serving Institutions said the grants are legal and help put its members on an even playing field.More than 500 colleges and universities are designated as Hispanic-Serving Institutions, making them eligible for the grants. It includes flagship campuses like the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Arizona, along with many community colleges and smaller institutions.Related ArticlesThese Orange County students are 2026 National Merit Scholarship semifinalistsThis California town was ravaged by a wildfire.

Patty Murray, D-Wash., said Trump is “putting politics ahead of students simply looking to get ahead.” She drew attention to the government’s current funding bill, a stopgap measure passed in March that gives the administration more flexibility to redirect federal funding.“This is another important reminder of why Congress needs to pass funding bills, like the one the Senate marked up this summer, that ensure Congress — not Donald Trump or Linda McMahon — decides how limited taxpayer dollars are spent,” Murray said in a statement.The Education Department said it will still release about $132 million for similar grant programs that are considered mandatory, meaning their levels are dictated by existing laws. Even so, the department said it “continues to consider the underlying legal issues associated with the mandatory funding mechanism in these programs.”Former President Joe Biden made Hispanic universities a priority, signing an executive action last year that promised a new presidential advisory board and increased funding. President Donald Trump revoked the order on his first day back in office earlier this year.The Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

            "District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser urged the House Oversight Committee to reject 13 proposed bills this week aimed at how the district is governed. In a letter to Chairman James Comer (R-KY) and ranking member Robert Garcia (D-CA), Bowser pointed to some of the city’s progress on crime and public safety and argued the proposed legislation would make the city “less safe.” Bowser said the city has “worked collaboratively with this Committee on shared priorities,” but that she now asks that the committee “reject 13 of the DC bills before you today that encroach on DC’s Home Rule.” The city’s home rule allows residents to elect the mayor and the D.C. Council. The mayor specifically objected to House Rule 5183, the District of Columbia Home Rule Improvement Act, which would impose a 60-day congressional review for D.C. Council legislation, and H.R. 521, the District of Columbia Cash Bail Reform Act, which would mandate pretrial detention and cash bail for those charged with public safety offenses. Bowser argued that the Home Rule Improvement Act would “make the District less efficient, competitive, and responsive to the needs of a highly complex unique local government that serves local, county and state functions.” On the proposed cash bail reform, Bowser said the city’s “recent changes to our laws related to pre-trial detention [helped] to drive down violent crime in the last two years.” The mayor also asked the committee not to end the district’s education-funding Scholarships for Opportunity and Results Act. The committee has not yet released exact details on what it would end, but Bowser said she has been a career advocate of funding public, private, and charter schools. “Mayoral control, council oversight, and deep, targeted investments in our students, teachers, and buildings made these remarkable achievements possible,” she wrote. Members of the D.C. Council, including Chairman Phil Mendelson, have condemned the legislation, calling it a direct assault on the city’s home rule and local democracy. TRUMP AGAIN THREATENS DC’S HOME RULE: WHAT TO KNOW “Today's House Oversight Committee markup will hurt public safety and is a direct affront to the District's autonomy. Lawmakers who have not been elected by DC residents and have slim knowledge of DC laws have NO place trying to legislate for us. These bills are WRONG for DC!” Mendelson said in a social media post . The bills come as President Donald Trump’s 30-day federal crime emergency ends Wednesday at midnight. The mayor has said that coordination with federal law enforcement will continue, but the Metropolitan Police Department will no longer be taking direct orders from the White House. \n",

            "A new subject, Technology and Digital, will be introduced to primary school students nationwide starting in 2027. The Education Ministry, in a recent Dewan Rakyat sitting, announced that the subject will focus on building learners’ foundations in artificial intelligence (AI). The ministry added that the subject will carry through into secondary school, complementing related areas such as computer science, information and communications technology, and design and technology. On top of this, school curriculums will also include the “Fasih Digital” (digital literacy) programme, which has been identified as one of the seven core competency modules every student must master. This move is, without doubt, a reflection of how deeply technology is shaping not only our future, but also our classrooms. It also reflects the Education Ministry’s commitment in ensuring students, across the nation, are given early exposures to AI. The initiative is commendable, as AI is no longer just a futuristic concept but an integral part of our daily lives. From the way we shop online, interact with customer service bots, consume news, or even navigate traffic, AI quietly powers much of our routines. The decision to introduce AI in primary schools shows recognition that the future workforce cannot afford to be passive consumers of technology. It is no exaggeration to say that equipping young learners with AI knowledge and skills early will provide them with competencies that are not only relevant today but also critical for tomorrow’s job market. As industries—from healthcare to agriculture—rapidly embed AI into their operations, the demand for digitally literate workers will only continue to grow. Starting early also offers psychological benefits, as children are naturally curious and adaptive. By learning AI concepts at an age when imagination runs wild, they are more likely to approach the technology with a sense of possibility rather than fear. Learning these skills at an early age will undoubtedly nurture creativity and curiosity. It enables students to see AI not just as users, but as creators and innovators. For instance, instead of merely playing with apps, children could learn how those apps are designed, how chatbots are trained, or how algorithms make decisions. Experts often stress that introducing AI early helps to demystify the subject. Just as learning a second language becomes easier for children than for adults, learning the language of AI early will make it less intimidating as they grow. By normalising AI from the start, students may develop a sense of ownership over technology, not intimidation. This shift in mindset—from passive use to active creation—is crucial if Malaysia is serious about preparing a workforce capable of not only adopting AI but shaping it. But, for all its promise, this initiative also raises bigger questions. Are our schools truly ready to teach AI to children as young as seven? AI is not like teaching basic mathematics or spelling — it involves concepts that can be abstract and technical. Without proper training, there is a risk that teachers may struggle to simplify AI for young learners, leading to rote memorisation instead of genuine understanding. Are parents and teachers adequately prepared to guide children through such a leap? Parents play a critical role in reinforcing classroom learning at home. But if many parents themselves are unfamiliar with AI, how can they confidently support their children? Likewise, teachers must be given sufficient training, resources, and ongoing support to ensure they are not overwhelmed by yet another subject added to their already demanding workload. And perhaps most crucially, will this new subject ignite genuine curiosity and innovation—or will it risk becoming just another textbook-driven, exam-oriented subject? Malaysia’s education system has long been criticised for encouraging memorisation over critical thinking. If AI education becomes reduced to definitions, diagrams, and test answers, then the entire purpose of introducing it at an early age will be defeated. Bear in mind, if the ministry proceeds with this initiative, schools, students, teachers, and parents will have just over a year to prepare. That timeline is not generous. Preparing for AI education is not merely about printing new textbooks—it involves teacher training, curriculum development, infrastructure upgrades (such as ensuring schools have sufficient devices and internet access), and parental engagement. Consider rural schools, where even basic internet connectivity can be unreliable. How will they cope with a subject that requires exposure to digital tools and platforms? If the implementation gap is too wide, students in rural areas risk being left behind, thus widening the digital divide that already exists. That said, this initiative should not be viewed only through the lens of challenges. It also presents a rare opportunity to rethink how we teach. AI cannot be learned meaningfully through rote exercises; it demands experimentation, creativity, and problem-solving. Imagine if AI classes encouraged children to design simple projects — like creating chatbots that answer fun questions, or coding small programmes that recommend books based on preferences. Such activities could spark joy in learning, nurture innovation, and instil problem-solving skills that are transferable to many areas of life. Furthermore, by embedding AI into subjects like science, mathematics, or even art, students could see how technology intersects with different fields. This multidisciplinary approach would not only make AI more relatable but also break down silos in how knowledge is delivered. If the Education Ministry wants to be serious about this, preparation cannot be left until the last minute. Teacher training must begin immediately. Collaboration with universities, tech companies, and educational NGOs could help create training modules that are practical and accessible. Parents must also be engaged through awareness programmes, so they too can understand and support what their children are learning. The ministry must also be mindful of balancing ambition with reality. Rolling out AI education across the board is commendable, but it must not come at the expense of further straining schools that already lack resources. Ensuring equitable access should be the guiding principle. The introduction of Technology and Digital, with AI at its heart, marks a bold step towards aligning Malaysia’s education system with the realities of the 21st century. It is a recognition that the future will belong to those who can understand, navigate, and shape technology. But bold steps require careful preparation. We must ensure that this initiative does not simply add another subject to the timetable but becomes a catalyst for nurturing creativity, innovation, and critical thinking. Otherwise, the promise of teaching AI to seven-year-olds may risk becoming just another missed opportunity. With just over a year before the rollout, the clock is ticking. The questions are: how prepared are we today, and will we be ready to rise to the challenge when the time comes?

            "When I read that only 12 per cent of Australian year 12 students are now studying physics - the lowest level ever recorded - my heart sank. or signup to continue reading Physics is not just another subject. It's the foundation of critical thinking, innovation, and the technologies that power our daily lives. Without it, we don't just lose scientists in lab coats; we lose innovators, problem-solvers, and leaders across every industry. The 2025 Year 12 Physics Participation Report Card , released by the Australian Mathematical Sciences Institute and the Australian Institute of Physics, paints a bleak picture. Male participation has dropped from 23.5 per cent in 2015 to 18.9 per cent. Female participation has fallen even further, from 7 per cent to just 5.8 per cent. For decades, only one in four year 12 physics students has been female. No progress has been made in closing that gap. These numbers are more than statistics. They are a warning. Physics is not a niche field. It underpins healthcare, engineering, defence, finance, computing and energy. From MRI machines in hospitals, to renewable energy systems, to the algorithms inside our smartphones - physics is everywhere. Here in the Hunter, I see the impact first-hand. I've taught and mentored physics students at the University of Newcastle, and I've watched where they end up. Yes, many become engineers. But that's only part of the story. Our graduates are now data scientists at CSIRO, medical physicists in hospitals, software engineers at Telstra and Optus, and project managers at BHP and Ericsson. Some have become patent attorneys, lawyers at ASIC, or data analysts at the Australian Taxation Office. Others have stepped into leadership, becoming CEOs of local start-ups right here in the Hunter. And that's just from Newcastle graduates. When physics enrolments fall, we don't just lose scientists. We lose innovators across every corner of our economy. The future of clean energy, advanced computing, medical technology and national security depends on a steady pipeline of people trained to think critically and solve complex problems. That's what physics does best. So why are students turning away? The reasons are complex, but some patterns are clear. Physics is often labelled as difficult or abstract, and schools under pressure sometimes guide students towards \"easier\" subjects to maximise marks. Students also rarely see physicists who look like them, especially young women. In many rural and regional areas, the shortage of specialist physics teachers makes high-quality physics education even harder to access. Another barrier is perception. Too often, students believe \"physics\" must appear in a job title for it to matter. In reality, physics skills open doors in industries where the word never appears. Without visible career pathways, some students never see the value of sticking with it. This is where we must act. We need to make physics engaging and practical without watering it down. Students should see how it connects to the real world: from designing safer cars to modelling climate change. We need more hands-on experiments, more industry partnerships, and more visible role models in classrooms. We must also tackle gender equity head-on. It's not enough to say \"physics is for everyone\". We need programs that actively encourage girls to take and stay in physics, backed by mentoring, scholarships and visibility campaigns. And above all, we need to value our teachers. A physics classroom lives or dies on the passion of the person at the front. If we don't invest in training and retaining great physics teachers, the decline will only accelerate. Physics may be disappearing from our classrooms. But it doesn't have to. If we act now - as educators, parents, policymakers and industry leaders - we can turn this around. Because this isn't just about science education. It's about Australia's future workforce, our economy, and the innovations that will shape the world our kids inherit. I hope next year's report tells a different story. But that will happen only if we all step up. Daily Today's top stories curated by our news team. Also includes evening update.

            "Graduating cadets of the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA) have been advised to embrace early and long-term investment in the capital market as a pathway to sustainable wealth creation and financial security. The Director-General of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Dr Emomotimi Agama, gave the charge while delivering the 23rd Convocation Lecture for the 72 Regular Course and postgraduate students in Kaduna on Wednesday. Agama urged the cadets to clearly define their financial goals, both short and long term, and align their strategies with an ideal future that prioritises economic independence. “Public servants, traditionally reliant on fixed salaries and pensions, can achieve economic prosperity by strategically engaging with the capital market. “Capital markets, comprising stock exchanges, bond markets, and alternative investments, offer opportunities for wealth creation, passive income, and financial security. However, participation requires financial literacy,” Agama said. He explained that securities not only provide investors with a wide range of options to match their risk appetite and return expectations but also enable issuers—companies and governments – to raise much-needed capital for development projects. “Ultimately, the securities market serves as a vehicle to meet the complementary goals of both issuers and investors. Opportunities abound through equities, bonds, collective investment schemes, commodities, digital assets, and derivatives,” he added, while cautioning cadets to engage only with SEC-registered entities to safeguard their funds. In his remarks, NDA Commandant, Major General A. K. Ibrahim, noted that many officers face financial challenges after retirement due to poor resource management during their service years. “The reason we are having this lecture is because of the value we place on investment and empowerment issues for the military. With this enlightenment, our officers and men will be better positioned to manage their resources and secure wealth for their families,” he said . \n",

            "Monroe (La.) Ouachita Parish four-star defensive lineman Dylan Berymon will be in Oxford this weekend for the Ole Miss' Rebels SEC clash against the Arkansas Razorbacks. Berymon, the No. 4 rated prospect in Louisiana, revealed a commitment to Steve Sarkisian and the Texas Longhorns in June, but it hasn't stopped programs from remaining in contact. That includes Lane Kiffin and the Ole Miss Rebels with the program looking to stack talent in the trenches for the 2026 Recruiting Cycle. The 6-foot-1, 330-pounder has earned a myriad of offers across his time on the prep scene with the LSU Tigers, North Carolina Tar Heels, Oregon Ducks, Miami Hurricanes, and Mississippi State Bulldogs, among others, entering the race. But it's the Texas Longhorns that hold the verbal pledge after turning up the heat during the summer. Across his last two season on the high school scene, Berymon has logged more than 65 total tackles, including 15 for loss, to go along with 10 sacks. Now, the coveted defensive lineman will be up in Oxford (Miss.) this weekend for the Rebels' clash against the Arkansas Razorbacks. For Kiffin and Ole Miss program, all focus is on stacking talent in the 2026 Recruiting Cycle with the program fresh off of flipping UCF Knights defensive line pledge Jayden Curtis. The Ocean Springs (Miss.) native quickly emerged as a talented under-the-radar prospect in the Magnolia State with Kiffin and Co. turning up the heat across the offseason. The Mississippi native made his way up to Oxford in June to compete in the program's offensive line/defensive line camp without an offer in-hand, but after a strong performance, received a scholarship from the hometown program. Now, after a hard push, Ole Miss has added a talented piece to the trenches in the 2026 class after flipping him away from UCF. “The Rebels remained in touch and pushed the right buttons during his visit while showing how successful he can be on and off the field close to home,” Rivals wrote . “His father played basketball for Ole Miss, and he has family connections who live within a short distance of the campus. And the Rebels’ production and development along the defensive line is a major feather in their cap, too.” No. 17 Ole Miss will return to action on Saturday night at Vaught Hemingway Stadium for an SEC matchup against the Arkansas Razorbacks.

            "RIPLEY, W.Va. (WV News) -- The Jackson County Board of Education members spent a substantial amount of time learning about the FOCUS plans that each school develops. Dr. Bill Chapman, Director of Federal Programs and Child Nutrition, explained the process that provides schools with the means to develop action plans. “FOCUS is an acronym,” Chapman explained, “It stands for find the starting point, organize the data, communicate the goals and action steps, involve the stakeholders, and sustain the monitoring.” Each staff member is given an opportunity to take an anonymous survey in which they rate their school in seven areas, including home-school communication, high expectations, facilities, and technology. These are called ‘self-reflection surveys.’ Dr. Chapman and his team compile the data to send a report to the school’s administration. The school’s principal works with his staff to brainstorm and develop an action plan to address any issues. “This is our third year doing this,” Chapman said. “We were able to identify problems and work on solutions. Teachers and support staff are saying this is the first time they have felt heard.” This year, unlike the past, the county administration will ‘focus’ on six schools rather than all twelve. The other six will be the focus next year. “We will be working with Kenna, Ripley Elementary, Ripley Middle, Ravenswood Middle, Ripley High, and Gilmore,” Chapman stated. The survey has received over 200 responses so far this year. “We are seeing lower dissatisfaction results,” he said. “That is encouraging.” Enrollment has increased slightly (by three students) compared to the end of the previous school year, at 3,945. The full impact of the Hope Scholarship, which provides state funds for students attending private schools, has yet to be calculated. The full scholarship is available in August, but it goes down incrementally. The superintendent was asked to provide an update at the end of the 45 days allowed for Hope Scholarship applications. Assistant Superintendent of Non-Instructional Services Tim Brown gave his construction update: Superintendent Will Hosaflook discussed an unsigned letter he had received. He said he normally doesn’t address these types of correspondence, but this one questioned and criticized contributions to community events. “We represent the community and the community represents us,” Hosaflook said. “Much of the time given, such as helping with races, is done for free, for no personal gain.” Board member Bea Isner expressed her views. “Schools are the hub of our community,” she said. “And the community is the hub of the school. For anyone to complain about this assistance is just sad.” In other business, board members Jim Frazier, Ben Mize, Steve Chancey, Dan Barnette, and Isner: To start the board meeting, a retiree was honored. Stacy Riffe retired with 32 years of service at Ripley High School. “It has been a blessing and an honor,” Riffe said. “I owe it all to God.” The board went into a closed-door executive meeting to discuss the superintendent’s goals for the 2025-26 school year. Those goals were not shared after returning to the open meeting. It was explained that the goals were used to determine the superintendent’s evaluation at the end of the school year.

            "The Department of Health and Human Services has instructed all employees to use ChatGPT, according to recent reports from 404 Media and Gizmodo. Robert F Kennedy Jr, the new leader of the HHS, oversaw the agency's new email to employees on Tuesday entitled \"AI Deployment.\" Why It Matters Kennedy has received a wide range of backlash since taking on the job of HHS Secretary. More than 1,000 current and former employees of the HHS called for Kennedy to resign in an open letter earlier this month, citing several actions that continue \"to endanger the nation's health,\" according to the letter. Artificial intelligence has grown in popularity, transforming workplaces, healthcare and education. However, experts say its use in a government healthcare setting could have longstanding implications for both workers and beneficiaries alike. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. appears before the Senate Finance Committee at the Dirksen Senate Office Building on September 04, 2025, in Washington, D.C. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. appears before the Senate Finance Committee at the Dirksen Senate Office Building on September 04, 2025, in Washington, D.C. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images What To Know ChatGPT will now be available to all workers at HHS, and its deployment will be overseen by HHS's new CIO, former Palantir employee Clark Minor, according to the email. \"Artificial intelligence is beginning to improve health care, business, and government,\" the email, sent by deputy secretary Jim O'Neill, said. \"Our department is committed to supporting and encouraging this transformation. In many offices around the world, the growing administrative burden of extensive emails and meetings can distract even highly motivated people from getting things done. We should all be vigilant against barriers that could slow our progress toward making America healthy again.\" The email continued to say ChatGPT would be available to everyone in the department effective immediately. \"Some operating divisions, such as FDA and ACF (Administration for Children and Families), have already benefitted from specific deployments of large language models to enhance their work, and now the rest of us can join them. This tool can help us promote rigorous science, radical transparency, and robust good health. As Secretary Kennedy said, 'The AI revolution has arrived.'\" Kennedy has criticized the HHS's vaccine program and also fired thousands of staff since taking the helm of the agency. Many top Centers for Disease Control and Prevention staff members have also left their roles in protest of Kennedy's policies, with the new director announced as O'Neill, who previously worked for conservative billionaire Peter Thiel . Newsweek reached out to the HHS for comment via email. What People Are Saying In a September 3 letter, a group of current and former HHS employees wrote: \"We warn the President, Congress , and the Public that Secretary Kennedy's actions are compromising the health of this nation, and we demand Secretary Kennedy's resignation.\" HHS Communications Director Andrew Nixon previously said: \"From his first day in office, [Kennedy] pledged to check his assumptions at the door—and he asked every HHS colleague to do the same. That commitment to evidence-based science is why, in just seven months, he and the HHS team have accomplished more than any health secretary in history in the fight to end the chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again.\" Alex Beene, a financial literacy instructor for the University of Tennessee at Martin, told Newsweek : \"Kennedy's approach is similar to some other leadership in the new administration that are looking to advance customer service and inner-department communication by employing artificial intelligence. On the surface, this seems like a step forward and could boost the output of the agency. At the same point, skeptics are concerned this could lead to dramatic reduction in workforce and eventually take its toll on the services offered. Kevin Thompson, the CEO of 9i Capital Group and the host of the 9innings podcast, told Newsweek : \"ChatGPT is only as good as the people supplying the input. If those providing the input don't truly understand the information, the results can be misleading and even harmful. I'm deeply concerned about how this could impact services moving forward, especially if the people using ChatGPT don't have a clear grasp of the very services they're deploying.\" What Happens Next Beene said it remains unclear how AI will affect the agency for better or worse, whether it increases efficiency or leads to lower quality services and job cuts. \"Ultimately, it will be up to HHS to demonstrate AI is net positive through better, more reliable service and hopefully not sacrificing many roles the department currently has,\" Beene said. \n",
