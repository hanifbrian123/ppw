We use them to conduct an extensive trend detection and analysis study on the collected data using machine learning-based approaches. This study successfully detects an AI trend and follows its evolution in business and political data sources over the past two decades.

Our results show that social media and news channel sites play a key role in the information diffusion process, while market and trading sites signal innovation adoption.

We seek to extend the knowledge base on innovation activity and the status quo of innovation in Mauritius by applying an unsupervised machine learning approach. Building on previous work on new experimental innovation indicators, we combine recent advances in web mining and topic modeling and address the following research questions: What are potential areas of innovation activity in the ICT sector of Mauritius? Furthermore, do web mining and topic modeling provide sufficient indicators to understand innovation activities in emerging countries? To answer these questions, we apply the natural language processing (NLP) technique of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to ICT companies’ website text data. We then generate topic models from the scraped text data. As a result, we derive seven categories that describe the innovation activities of ICT firms in Mauritius. Albeit the model approach fulfills the requirements for innovation indicators as suggested in the Oslo Manual, it needs to be combined with additional metrics for innovation, for example, with traditional indicators such as patents, to unfold its potential. Furthermore, our approach carries methodological implications and is intended to be reproduced in similar contexts of scarce or unavailable data or where traditional metrics have demonstrated insufficient explanatory power.'}","['Economics', 'Economic Policy', 'R & D/Technology Policy', 'Entrepreneurship']","[{'id': '7020', 'term': 'Economic Policy'}, {'id': '41916', 'term': 'Economic Development, Innovation and Growth'}, {'id': '3752', 'term': 'Entrepreneurship'}]",,,,

A diffusion kernel encodes such a process. This paper demonstrates several diffusion kernel approaches on a graph composed of user-item and item-item relationships.

For these domains, identifying the new necessary skills in a timely manner is a difficult task, where existing methods are inadequate. Understanding the process, by which these new skills and technologies appear in and diffuse through a professional domain, could give training providers more time to identify these new skills and react. For this purpose, in the present work, we look at the dynamics between online learning platforms and online hiring platforms in the software programming profession, a rapidly evolving domain. To do so, we fuse four data sources together: Stack Overflow, an online community questions and answers (Q&A) platform; Google Trends, which provides online search trends from Google; Udemy, a platform offering skill-based Massively Open Online Courses (MOOCs) where anyone can create courses; and Stack Overflow Jobs, a job ad platform. We place these platforms along two axes: i) how much expertise it takes, on average, to create content on them, and ii) whether, in general, the decision to create content on them is made by individuals or by groups. Our results show that the topics under study have a systematic tendency to appear earlier on platforms where content creation requires (on average) less expertise and is done more individually, rather than by groups: Stack Overflow is found to be more agile than Udemy, which is itself more agile than Stack Overflow Jobs (Google Trends did not prove usable due to extreme data sparsity). However, our results also show that this tendency is not present for all new skills, and that the software programming profession as a whole is remarkably agile: there are usually only a few months between the first Stack Overflow appearance of a new topic, and its first appearance on Udemy or Stack Overflow Jobs. In addition, we find that Udemy’s agility has dramatically increased over time. Our novel methodology is able to provide valuable insights into the dynamics between online education and job ad platforms, enabling training program creators to look at said dynamics for various topics and to understand the pace of change. This allows them to maintain better awareness of the trends and to prioritize their attention, both on the right topics and on the right platforms.'}","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Educational Technology', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Computers and Education']","[{'id': '2970', 'term': 'Artificial Intelligence'}, {'id': '8186', 'term': 'Digital Education and Educational Technology'}, {'id': '7147', 'term': 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction'}, {'id': '6060', 'term': 'Computers and Education'}]",,,,

Websites of firms are a particularly interesting data source for innovation research, as they are used for publishing information about potentially innovative products, services, and cooperation with other firms. Analyzing the textual and relational content on these websites and extracting innovation-related information from them has the potential to provide researchers and policy-makers with a cost-effective way to survey millions of businesses and gain insights into their innovation activity, their cooperation, and applied technologies. For this purpose, we propose a web mining framework for consistent and reproducible mapping of innovation ecosystems. In a large-scale pilot study we use a database with 2.4\xa0million German firms to test our framework and explore firm websites as a data source. Thereby we put particular emphasis on the investigation of a potential bias when surveying innovation systems through firm websites if only certain firm types can be surveyed using our proposed approach. We find that the availability of a websites and the characteristics of the website (number of subpages and hyperlinks, text volume, language used) differs according to firm size, age, location, and sector. We also find that patenting firms will be overrepresented in web mining studies. Web mining as a survey method also has to cope with extremely large and hyper-connected outlier websites and the fact that low broadband availability appears to prevent some firms from operating their own website and thus excludes them from web mining analysis. We then apply the proposed framework to map an exemplary innovation ecosystem of Berlin-based firms that are engaged in artificial intelligence. Finally, we outline several approaches how to transfer firm website content into valuable innovation indicators.'}","['Computer Science', 'Information Storage and Retrieval', 'Library Science']","[{'id': '5864', 'term': 'Information Storage and Retrieval'}, {'id': '4584', 'term': 'Library Science'}]",,,,

Because of their impact, manufacturers and retailers are highly concerned with customer feedback and reviews. Reliance on online reviews gives rise to the potential concern that wrongdoers may create false reviews to artificially promote or devalue products and services. This practice is known as Opinion (Review) Spam, where spammers manipulate and poison reviews (i.e., making fake, untruthful, or deceptive reviews) for profit or gain. Since not all online reviews are truthful and trustworthy, it is important to develop techniques for detecting review spam. By extracting meaningful features from the text using Natural Language Processing (NLP), it is possible to conduct review spam detection using various machine learning techniques. Additionally, reviewer information, apart from the text itself, can be used to aid in this process. In this paper, we survey the prominent machine learning techniques that have been proposed to solve the problem of review spam detection and the performance of different approaches for classification and detection of review spam. The majority of current research has focused on supervised learning methods, which require labeled data, a scarcity when it comes to online review spam. Research on methods for Big Data are of interest, since there are millions of online reviews, with many more being generated daily. To date, we have not found any papers that study the effects of Big Data analytics for review spam detection. The primary goal of this paper is to provide a strong and comprehensive comparative study of current research on detecting review spam using various machine learning techniques and to devise methodology for conducting further investigation.'}","['Computer Science', 'Database Management', 'Information Storage and Retrieval', 'Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery', 'Computational Science and Engineering', 'Mathematical Applications in Computer Science', 'Communications Engineering, Networks']","[{'id': '7402', 'term': 'Database Management'}, {'id': '5864', 'term': 'Information Storage and Retrieval'}, {'id': '3820', 'term': 'Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery'}, {'id': '4149', 'term': 'Computational Science and Engineering'}, {'id': '4364', 'term': 'Mathematical Applications in Computer Science'}, {'id': '4404', 'term': 'Communications Engineering, Networks'}]",,,,

While traditional methods offer information about the early phases of R&D and invention through publications and patents, web mining offers insights that are more downstream in the innovation process. Handling website data is not as easy as alternative data sources, and care needs to be taken in executing search strategies.
