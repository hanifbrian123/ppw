This study focuses on sustainability communication in official destination websites for informing and motivating visitors to adopt sustainable practices and behaviors. To advance previous research in this area, it adopts a web content mining approach to assess the characteristics of online contents of a sample of 20 Italian cultural destinations. The main dimensions and typologies of sustainability-oriented practices in tourism are used as basis to develop a text classifier for the automated content analysis. A total of 2.975 web pages from official city websites and official tourism promotion websites of the destinations is analyzed through this approach to investigate the online contents relating to the environmental, economic, socio-cultural and general dimensions sustainability as well as their emotional appeal. The analysis reveals that about 15.8% of total online texts contains information to promote sustainability-oriented behaviors at the destination. It indicates that the communication is more specifically focused on environmental/economic/socio-cultural practices than generically referring to sustainable/responsible tourism. However, in line with previous research, it highlights that destinations do not sufficiently balance these pillars in their online communication. Further, the websites’ texts scarcely leverage the persuasive potential of affective appealing messages. The implications of this automated approach for improving the design of online sustainability-related contents are also discussed.'}","['Business and Management', 'Tourism Management', 'IT in Business', 'Environmental Management', 'Cultural Economics']","[{'id': '7101', 'term': 'Tourism Management'}, {'id': '3205', 'term': 'IT in Business'}, {'id': '3693', 'term': 'Environmental Management'}, {'id': '4968', 'term': 'Cultural Economics'}]",,,,,,,,,,,

Firm characteristics and relationships, value chain positioning, and factors associated with product entry are examined for a set of 65 graphene-oriented small and medium-sized enterprises located in 16 different countries. As well as secondary sources and bibliometric methods to profile developments in graphene, we use computerized data mining and analytical techniques, including cluster and regression modeling, to identify patterns from publicly available online information on enterprise web sites. We identify groups of graphene small and medium-sized enterprises differentiated by how they are involved with graphene, the materials they target, whether they make equipment, and their orientation toward science and intellectual property. In general, access to finance and the firms’ location are significant factors that are associated with graphene product introductions. We also find that patents and scientific publications are not statistically significant predictors of product development in our sample of graphene enterprises. We further identify a cohort of graphene-oriented firms that are signaling plans to develop intermediate graphene products that should have higher value in the marketplace. Our findings suggest that policy needs to ensure attention to the introduction and scale-up of downstream intermediate and final graphene products and associated financial, intermediary, and market identification support. The paper demonstrates novel data methods that can be combined with existing information for real-time intelligence to understand and map enterprise development and commercialization in a rapidly emerging and growing new technology.'}","['Materials Science', 'Nanotechnology', 'Inorganic Chemistry', 'Characterization and Evaluation of Materials', 'Physical Chemistry', 'Optics, Lasers, Photonics, Optical Devices']","[{'id': '3460', 'term': 'Nanotechnology'}, {'id': '2895', 'term': 'Inorganic Chemistry'}, {'id': '4741', 'term': 'Characterization and Analytical Technique'}, {'id': '2894', 'term': 'Physical Chemistry'}, {'id': '3149', 'term': 'Laser'}]",1388-0764,1572-896X,18,9,Regular,,1,24,11051,2016-10-04,2016-09
