To identify robots and humans in web archives and analyze their respective access patterns, we used the Internet Archive’s (IA) Wayback Machine access logs from 2012, 2015, and 2019, as well as Arquivo.pt’s (Portuguese Web Archive) access logs from 2019. We identified user sessions in the access logs and classified those sessions as human or robot based on their browsing behavior. To better understand how users navigate through the web archives, we evaluated these sessions to discover user access patterns. Based on the two archives and between the three years of IA access logs (2012 vs. 2015 vs. 2019), we present a comparison of detected robots vs. humans and their user access patterns and temporal preferences. The total number of robots detected in IA 2012 (91% of requests) and IA 2015 (88% of requests) is greater than in IA 2019 (70% of requests). Robots account for 98% of requests in Arquivo.pt (2019). We found that the robots are almost entirely limited to “Dip” and “Skim” access patterns in IA 2012 and 2015, but exhibit all the patterns and their combinations in IA 2019. Both humans and robots show a preference for web pages archived in the near past.'}","['Computer Science', 'Database Management', 'Information Systems and Communication Service']","[{'id': '7402', 'term': 'Database Management'}, {'id': '4767', 'term': 'Computer Engineering and Networks'}]"

We discuss our approach aimed at assessing a purchase probability in a user session depending on categories of viewed products and session features. We apply association rule mining to real online bookstore data. The results show differences in factors indicating a high purchase probability in session for both customer types. The discovered association rules allow us to formulate some predictions for the online store, e.g. that a logged user who has viewed only traditional, printed books, has been staying in the store from 10 to 25\xa0min, and has opened between 30 and 75 pages, will decide to confirm a purchase with the probability of more than 92\xa0%.'}","['Business and Management', 'IT in Business', 'Information Systems Applications (incl.Internet)', 'Management']","[{'id': '3205', 'term': 'IT in Business'}, {'id': '3121', 'term': 'Computer and Information Systems Applications'}, {'id': '3248', 'term': 'Management'}]"

Yet, evidence indicates that patients rarely use this information in their decision-making, due to limited awareness of the data and complex and conflicting information. While there is enthusiasm among policy makers for public reporting, clinicians and researchers doubt its overall impact. Almost no study has analyzed how users behave on public reporting portals, which information they seek out and when they abort their search.', 'Methods', 'This study employs web-usage mining techniques on server log data of 17 million user actions from Germany’s premier provider transparency portal Weisse-Liste.de ( WL.de ) between 2012 and 2015. Postal code and ICD search requests facilitate identification of geographical and treatment area usage patterns. User clustering helps to identify user types based on parameters like session length, referrer and page topic visited. First-level markov chains illustrate common click paths and premature exits.', 'Results', 'In 2015, the WL.de Hospital Search portal had 2,750 daily users, with 25% mobile traffic, a bounce rate of 38% and 48% of users examining hospital quality information. From 2013 to 2015, user traffic grew at 38% annually. On average users spent 7\xa0min on the portal, with 7.4 clicks and 54\xa0s between clicks. Users request information for many oncologic and orthopedic conditions, for which no process or outcome quality indicators are available. Ten distinct user types, with particular usage patterns and interests, are identified. In particular, the different types of professional and non-professional users need to be addressed differently to avoid high premature exit rates at several key steps in the information search and view process. Of all users, 37% enter hospital information correctly upon entry, while 47% require support in their hospital search.', 'Conclusions', 'Several onsite and offsite improvement options are identified. Public reporting needs to be directed at the interests of its users, with more outcome quality information for oncology and orthopedics. Customized reporting can cater to the different needs and skill levels of professional and non-professional users. Search engine optimization and hospital quality advocacy can increase website traffic.']}","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Health Informatics', 'Information Systems and Communication Service', 'Management of Computing and Information Systems']","[{'id': '4129', 'term': 'Health Informatics'}, {'id': '4767', 'term': 'Computer Engineering and Networks'}, {'id': '5793', 'term': 'IT Operations'}]"

This has changed the nature of higher education and led to a new mobile form of e-learning known as m-learning. The aim of this article is to assess the penetration of mobile devices for learning purposes in higher education and to identify the main usage patterns. To that end, the study used two complementary methodologies: web usage mining and a questionnaire survey. Web usage mining was performed to collect data from the university’s learning management system (LMS) in order to explore this new technology’s usage trends in the past four academic years and to identify the main patterns of behaviour. A questionnaire survey of 460 university students was conducted to find out about the student-declared level of m-learning penetration. The results are conclusive: 25% of accesses to the LMS were made from mobile devices and 75% of the students used these devices for learning purposes. The findings of this study have significant implications not only for researchers and lecturers, but also for institutions intending to implement this teaching/learning methodology.'}","['Computer Science', 'Computers and Education', 'Educational Technology', 'Higher Education', 'Computer Appl. in Social and Behavioral Sciences', 'Statistics for Social Sciences, Humanities, Law', 'Information Systems Applications (incl.Internet)']","[{'id': '6060', 'term': 'Computers and Education'}, {'id': '8186', 'term': 'Digital Education and Educational Technology'}, {'id': '4114', 'term': 'Higher Education'}, {'id': '6481', 'term': 'Computer Application in Social and Behavioral Sciences'}, {'id': '5760', 'term': 'Statistics in Social Sciences, Humanities, Law, Education, Behavorial Sciences, Public Policy'}, {'id': '3121', 'term': 'Computer and Information Systems Applications'}]"
